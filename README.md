# defiCorpus
#### A DeFi-native corpus built using ntlk & gensim.

The initial focus is Discourse-based Web3 Governance forums, but will be adding material from several mediums in the future. 

Crypto news articles to be collected using the https://cryptopanic.com/ public API, found here: https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/about.

Free to use under MIT license, and of course, free to improve :)

Cheers

TODO: social media, newsy, whitepaper collection 

Note: Separating into several datasets to be merged after full review
