# defiCorpus
#### A DeFi-native corpus built using ntlk & gensim.

**The initial focus is Discourse-based Web3 Governance forums, but will be adding material from several mediums in the future.** 

*The first pass came from a collection of DeFi protocols:* 

* Aave
* Balancer
* Compound
* Frax
* GMX
* Instadapp
* Lido
* Maker
* Rocketpool
* Sushiswap
* Uniswap
* Vesta
* Yearn

Crypto news articles to be collected from Decrypt, The Block, the rest TDB. 

Free to use and free to improve :)

Cheers!

*TODO: social media, newsy, whitepaper collection* 

**Note: Separating into several datasets to be merged after full review. Current train/test data needs a decent chunk of processing work.**

UPDATE: Whitepaper collection almost complete. Going to initally split into technical & social datasets.
