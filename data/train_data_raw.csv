There has been a lot of discussion around whether the “ Fee Switch ” should be turned on .
In the Forums Protocol maintenance .
Hope this helps !
"Even in principle , I don ’ t think this is the protocol ’ s job ."
I ’ m saying that we need more specific parameters that we ’ re testing .
"The best example is in the case of hacks or other critical risks , in which case mitigating the risk immediately takes the top spot as focus objective ."
"With low witnessed user overlap between Aave deployment , these EVM Alt L1 networks have fully fledged communities and assets that make them different and valuable outside of the Ethereum sphere while conserving the Ethereum technology via EVM making deployment there almost seamless for the Aave protocol ."
"We ’ re talking here about enabling it for specific pools that , if unlocked , hold no risk for the Frax peg and ends up being a net win for the protocol ."
Provide basic information on what success looks like for each initiative For instance   COMP reward management .
The proposal is linked with the Ethereum block hash of the creation ’ s moment .
"Count intuitively , should this proposal pass , it could make canFRAX one of the safest assets on non ETH chains because it has the full faith and commitment to redeem against FRAX on Ethereum L1 while having 0 bridge risk ."
This would be a requirement to fit the properties of an AMO .
I really enjoy adding back to the ecosystem where I can .
"There is always someone who will be a month late , but the state of the market will not give him enough time ."
There are two potential lending outcomes .
We see options 1 and 3 as the most viable options .
It is a good organization to support .
Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade .
"We propose a synergy between Axelar and Abacus inheriting the PoS validator set model of Axelar ( AXL tokens , which could potentially in an application specific setting be just the UNI tokens ) with the application customizability of Abacus as having the ideal model for Uniswap ’ s current purposes , with UNI token holders freely participating in the system ( this can be implemented in a variety of ways ) ."
We chose the base+bonus model because it is a tried and tested one .
the issue is important but thess governance and planing are also important .
"Furthermore , Aave can vote for pools on Balancer that create TVL for Aave such as linear pools , bb a wETH , for example that deposit ETH into Aave to earn yield ."
"If OpenZeppelin missed some major security issue , but then Certora ’ s FV service found it ."
"Thanks for posting this information , it can be very useful for newbies ."

"ok , a few things here to look at then ."
"Can you clarify whether the Gnosis Chain team will be deploying , and whether the bridge architecture you linked to in your post is what will be used to facilitate governance of the Gnosis Chain instance ?"
"Since going live on Mainnet in June of 2019 , the network has produced 30M+ blocks with 477 million transactions in publicly traded , native ONE tokens ."
We were delighted and humbled by the response from the Uniswap community with over > 99 percent voting in favour of the proposal .
Our farming contracts were audited by Paladin https : //paladinsec.co/projects/hermes defi/ as part of our commitment to safety .
"If they choose that latter option , they are sacrificing immediate spending money in favor of the idea that the valuation of the tokens will increase as their projects mature ."
The Centrifuge protocol supports transparency so the community can track RWA collateral in real time .
"Cabe destacar que soy un ignoto nivel 0,1 en blockchain y ethereum y Maker y etc etc aprendiendo todos los dias un poco ."
"I have no problem with entities like Llama proposing ad hoc strategies , but I ’ m fully against having an entity whose role is to optimize these holdings ; not at the current moment ."
"Also , excess market operation on FXS can have unwanted adverse effects on FXS price volatility ."
One of the many issue most DAOs face today is the lack of community contributor who are well incentivized and have deep knowledge of the ins and outs of the code base ; While the companies behind those protocol often work on others projects and sidequests as the marketing or financial upside looks more rewarding than focusing on innovation of the OG protocols .
"Neither of these suggestions is really longer term in nature , where user actions help restore the peg or automated tasks help run profitable strategies that also support the peg ."
"unfortunately , watching ."
"Circle holds euros at regulated , leading financial institutions , beginning with Silvergate Bank in the United States ."
"Let ’ s be clear again , I ’ m probably one of the main critics in the past of Gauntlet ( and support when good work was done ofc ) , and honestly , the name behind the risk vendor doesn ’ t really matter to me , if it is fully professional and optimal in all senses for the DAO ."
Currently balancer does most of the stablecoin volume in polygon and they have a 0.01 percent fee .
Long the Bored Ghosts
"However , the root of the problem , as @ compound101 has noted , is that “ DAO governance and contracting are difficult ” ."
"Process First , a note about our process ."
"For v2 Polygon and v2 AVAX , we currently offer risk analysis ( asset listings , risk modeling for key market events ) with the full integration and risk simulations slated for March 2023 ."

Where does the liquidity come from ?
"One important note on this model is to recognize the current ecosystem context , most existing bridges are currently implementing fixed fees in a 5 to 10 bps range , any fixed fee model shall be considered to be compatible with the current ecosystem to stay as an attractive tool for the protocols potentially integrating Portals ."
Thank you so much for everything you have done .
"In addition to creating the product , we will create a dashboard that will report the inputs and the paths covered by the different inputs , as well as rule violations that may occur ."
Having a risk provider who doesn ’ t understand such basic facts ( especially when there are at least three others who do ! )
I ’ m totally for it : incentives that are growing markets and adding utility to FRAX are definitely welcomed .
"This model is scalable , repeatable , modular , and easily toggled as per the performance of our partners ."
Good for the project .
Summary We are very much looking forward for the Metis team to fully implement all the mechanisms described in their blog posts and documentation so that full assessment of the security of their proposed architecture can be performed .
"Instead of rewriting new governance proposals for separate bridges and new chains , integration with LayerZero empowers the Community to write one proposal with zero additional custom code to pass on all active chains ."
"Also will the fee switch automatically turn off after the testing period , or will it continue ?"
"@ Derek , a very informal question : could you provide a figure of how much it would cost to get this properly audited ( both allocating PECO resources and paying a coupe of external top level auditors ) , in a reasonable time ?"
i dont think it will be much of a issue to cut it back to a 3 day chat thread if there are no negative comments about the proposal before the vote goes up .
Even on old cToken models ( the original contract ) the interest rate model can be replaced—while the code of how the cToken itself works is immutable .
Good growth for both parties .
"Maximum to be spent , but most probably over estimated if no important issues are found ."
"Es por ello que al enterarme de DAI , e investigarla a fondo , puedo afirmar que esta moneda estable puede ser la alternativa más sana respecto al dólar americano ."
"If the audit included any high risk issues , could you address what those were and how they ’ ve been resolved ?"
Do these converge with industry standards ?
"We ’ d encourage more justification , as outlined above , before doing so , given the added risks of changing the interest rate curve ."
"We ’ re Penn Blockchain ( @ PennBlockchain on twitter ) , a leading , completely student run blockchain DAO from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools ."
Payments will be processed according to the underlying loan documentation and the participation agreement .

"When dealing in stablecoin positions , the threshold is a 90 percent negative PnL relative to supplied collateral ."
I submitted a bug bounty detailing the exact CRV attack well before it happened and was ignored and not paid a bug bounty .
"In general , Uniswap has very few on chain parameters ."
"After that time , the community can base their judgment on the reality of having ChaosLabs as a partner in Aave and not on a theoretical discussion ."
Preview of DAIF ’ s Core Unit Expenses page Other noteworthy dashboard aspects : Responsiveness : We ’ ve built the dashboard with flexibility in mind and optimized the frontend designs for the majority of desktop and mobile screens .
"Quality project on top of Aave , but really early ."
"In summary overall risk exposures have increased , although Frax is still in a very healthy risk position with many levers to manage risk ."
"Gauntlet ’ s risk parameter update , part of their regular recommendations , was canceled pending a fix to the Oracle ."
"you have the collateral to back the loan so i see no reason why you would be so shy to use it , you also plan to use the $ 10m to generate an income while FRAX ’ s income in reduce so i see no reason why you would not offer to cover the difference ."
"We can learn a few things from this event : MKR burn of around 1 percent yearly didn ’ t have any effect on the price , Flop actions have a disastrous effect on MKR price , The short sightedness of MKR holders was a direct cause for flop actions   if revenues would be funneled to increase surplus buffer instead , it would be big enough to cover the losses ( it would be around $ 7M ) , A short period of massive burn   Jan 2022 838×840 21.9 KB 1266×856 37.4 KB In the recent market pullback , liquidations generated $ 20M surplus that was later spent on flap auctions ."
Executive summary This proposal describes a series of simple governance changes to MakerDAO that would address many problems that exist in governance today .
"That being said , Proposal 135 strikes in my mind the right balance between limiting utility and risk , and I plan to vote for the proposal ."
"Point of contact for security disclosures and action SURE On open DeFi protocols , there are from time to time security disclosures of potential technicals problems ."
"I note that you have gone into the Final Proposal ( which was linked as the Final in the actual approved/voted on Proposal ) , and the doc has been modified to reflect that there are changes to the Fee Structure ( ( i ) modification from 6 months to Quarterly , and lower , under bulletpoint 2 from the retainer fee from 2 payments , to 4 payments . )"
"Two community members ( @ GabePZ and @ jony ) also included more in depth frameworks which we are excited to leverage in Phase 2 of the program   with additional community feedback , analysis , and the benefit of learnings from Phase 1 ."
Does the protocol automatically sell rewards to pay down interest as it accrues ?
Is this really a valid assumption ?
"I think we could use some consolidation as it ’ s hard to read all the updates from all the different core units and get a good picture of what actually matters , how much it matters , when it will matter ."

@ harsha provides an update on Questbook ’ s delegated domain allocation : it looks like a proposal is in the works for next week .
We ’ d love for Gauntlet and other risk contributors to do the same .
"Moreover , we imagine millions of dollars of locked idle funds sitting on proposal funnels to be deposited in low risk protocols such as Aave to generate yield. ” Edge   $ 10,000 ( full )   applications and integrations a mobile self custody wallet with end to end deposits and withdraws directly into a bank account , awarded grant will be used for the native integration of Aave ’ s borrowing , and lending using WBTC as collateral Aave Academy   DoDAO   $ 9,600 ( full )   community ( marketing and educational ) a set of two interactive courses one aimed at being an introduction to Aave and the second an Aave centric developer course covering relevant smart contracts , fetching Aave data , writing a simple UI application on top of Aave and more ."
About GFX Labs isn ’ t a fund .
Marian : What would be Maker ’ s plan of action in case these regulations become too aggressive ?
What if EF changes ?
4 .
What about start to move some other LPs from UNI 2/3 to FraxSwap and wait until the market to settle down ?
This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer .
"Err , maybe raise new money But no , yeah–the SportsDAI Core Unit is just a dream ."
@ PaulFrambot also makes good points .
Interfacing between the CU and the community .
The same max cost would be then also carried by stETH/ETH recursive positions .
Context : The MakerDAO Community recently approved the MIP13c3 SP12 proposal .
"Just one question , will this be something you will be doing in the future again ?"
"Contributors are only eligible to purchase YFI up to 100 percent of the compensation amount they received that month , once the discount has been factored in ."
One possible improvement may be the following : Trading volume normalization parameter Investigate whether rewarding markets partially based on [ logarithmic ] trading volume can increase profit and TVL 2 .
"Although these products are freely transferable , and after the primary sale , the company has no ability to control their circulation , the company expects all token holders to follow the rules and restrictions defined in the prospectus and also described in the contract code ."
"fubuloubu : As a note , in many tax jurisdictions , receiving a discount on the purchase of stocks from an issuing company is considered to be a source of income , and the capital gains definition can not apply ."
Uniswap is pretty low on the list for a major trading pair .
I am strongly against the proposal as it currently stands .
"MakerMan : Is it the case that the only control over the portfolio is this credit rating of 6 and the types of loans and not the relative allocations between the types of loans , nor any control over geographic spread ?"

"Lower quorum requirements ( 320k AAVE ) , a voting period of 3 days , and a timelock of 1 day ."
"If we ’ re already unlocking the FXS Frax liquidity ( which is introducing a lot of risk , even if it is quantifiable in some respects ) , I ’ d rather see it get added to the veFXS pool and be rewarded from protocol profit rather than emissions ."
And see here the explanation by GFX Labs of a slightly different approach that would enable on chain ( instead of off chain ) polling .
"In total , Aave Arc was featured in 18 issues and attracted a total of 3,691 cumulative clicks to apply with Fireblocks and 982,910 impressions ."
Trust structures ) I generally defer to @ christiancdpetersen as he is a lawyer and I am not .
"I have a use case where after cloning a contract I would need in m time to do a function call , the task to be automated would be in the future ."
"If , for example , rates reverse tack and begin declining , HVBs ( and thus Maker ’ s ) fixed rate positions would appreciate accordingly ."
New Collateral Types Work with Balancer to bring a new type of productive collateral to Aave markets and subsequently roll it out across the various Aave V3 deployments .
Eg .
"Thus , there will be high demand for borrowing ETH ."
"Hi all , Recently the v2 cCOMP market has seen high utilization , with total borrowings currently at the 90,750 COMP borrow cap ."
"However , the Harmony blockchain lacks a comprehensive , easy to use , and efficient DeFi platform ."
The CU forecasts monthly a 3 month expected budget and benchmarks the actuals against forecasts .
"Yes , there appears to be a simple fix to UAV3 that will accommodate cETH ."
Nice to see a focus on deploying v3 first and accumulating more treasury assets from protocol usage .
"Preview of the Core Unit Table search function Core Unit Landing page : Discover the most important aspects of individual Core Units When clicking on a specific Core Unit , you will arrive at their landing page ."

"Tuxedo Mask : Utterly seductive , although sometimes mysterious in his ways ."
"clearly you want a liquidity provider , but on what chain , or will it be frax on more then one chain ?"
"This was supposed to be a top project in the automation of processes and even the rewards are given manually depending on a governance team that has no interest in their community that I trust them , we only ask for transparency and communication , we know that it is our responsibility this investment but the value of vKP3R is still blocked there , if they have to dissolve the treasure they should do it or if they have a roadmap they should publish it , but why the silence ?"
"Fundamentally , I think the idea of introducing borrowing caps is problematic and might cause volume to migrate to Aave ."
"It ’ s my belief that by hiring top talent , we ’ ll have maximum impact with as little management overhead as possible , making us an efficient and effective powerhouse ."
"Out of scope Protocol development work ( e.g. , Solidity changes that improve risk/reward ) Formalized mechanism design outside of the supported parameters Duration 1 year engagement ( Dec 5 , 2022 to Dec 5 , 2023 ) Expectations Key Performance Indicators Gauntlet aims to improve the following key metrics without increasing the protocol ’ s net insolvent value percentage : Value at Risk : conveys capital at risk due to insolvencies when markets are under duress ( i.e. , Black Thursday ) ."
The unexpected news : there were some difficulties with the Oracle upgrade .
juan : Does this replace MIP40s ?
"To rise to the level of competition that has been displayed on Ethereum , it is important to take time to research all of the most powerful tools available ."
"Supply Borrow Caps NewSupplyCap $ 7.5m stMATIC Opinion / Comments When more information about the timing of a Chainlink Oracle is made available for stMATIC , we will be able to reassess the liquidity and circulating supply on Polygon and determine if Isolation mode is suitable ."
"Each protocol differs from the code to community risk tolerance , and we do not want to be the only voice translating that into proposed changes ."
"So they combine the mortgagor ’ s ( yes , the borrower is a mortgagor ) crypto collateral with property collateral and offer better terms than competitors who are unable or unwilling to underwrite crypto ."
This is due to the competition of other searchers chasing after the same rewards .
In Discord Keep your eye on the new # events channel .
Snapshot vote must exceed a 50 percent threshold to be considered binding Governance : Execution & Conclusion The Keep3r multisig will ensure execution & allocation of funds from treasury upon completion of polling & snapshot voting phases if this proposal meets community approval .
The governance of the protocol is another key to long term Protocol sustainability that in our opinion requires some reinvigoration   we are excited to work with the community to ensure the governance process is efficient and effective .

"Using the events we outlined in our last proposal as a guide , AGD had a large presence at Permissionless , ETH Amsterdam , ETHCC and DevCon ."
Proponent of doing such in the near future .
"In the meantime , I pulled AGD ’ s spend ( including some pending transactions ) since May and compared it with the budget included in AGD ’ s previous proposal : Budgeted Cost Actual Spend Grants $ 3,055,000 $ 2,663,303 Sponsorships $ 2,418,500 $ 1,658,387 Operations $ 347,000 $ 245,569 Actual spend for Grants and Sponsorships is lower than the amount budgeted as we received 50 percent of our funding in AAVE ."
"It only makes accounting more complex , rather than bear any financial meaning ."
I support this proposal as Uniswaps ongoing ability to be a censorship resistant and open to all application depends on the ethereum base layer to have and maintain these same properties .
"As an example , let ’ s consider a hypothetical borrowing DAO , gamingDao , that purchases and loans out in game assets to generate liquid P2E tokens ."
"Chains that use a specific bridge as the predominant way to bring all tokens to their chain such as Fantom using Multichain bridged assets or Moonbeam using Nomad assets means that if those bridges are hacked , almost all tokens are worthless on their entire network except for canFRAX or canFXS ."
"Im not here to speculate and where Frax is going to be in a few months , my goal here is to set in stone an official arrangement and align incentives further between myself and Frax ."
4.Provide a brief history of the project and the different components : DAO ( is it live ? )
I hope this will be funded at a level that is still generous but also more closely proportional to Compound ’ s market presence .
"Either to core units/delegates , dai holders through mechanisms like the DSR , building the surplus buffer , or back to MKR investors in the form of a buyback ."
"Some aspects that contribute to a good developer experience include : Ability to get up and running quickly as a beginner Clear , thorough , and detailed documentation that ’ s easy to explore and facilitates learning Accessible developer community as a support resource Freedom and flexibility to take the preferred path towards a solution without rigid obstacles Ability to easily gather relevant technical information related to code failure Clear and explicit error messages that explain issues and suggest potential solutions Automatic resolution of tedious automatable tasks Reusable infrastructure to easily build ad hoc solutions Availability of specialized tools for domain specific problems ( local environments , programming editors , debuggers , etc ) Fast performance Developers are empowered to meet their objectives with a high degree of comfort and efficiency when there are high quality resources available , well designed architectures with APIs that get out of the way , and insightful tooling functionalities to address domain specific problems ."
That simplicity and clarity seems absent here   and I ’ m conscious that this isn ’ t even the complete plan !
"For example , Gamma mentioned that they would only invest effort into governance if proposals were more directly relevant to their operations ."
With respect to pools it ’ s not possible to do right now .
"Airdrop Airdrop should not be a one time event but spread out over 2 3 months as it can act as interest for locking FRAX/FXS LP , veFXS ."

He moved through the corporate bank assuming roles of additional responsibility including developing the West Coast market and lending in Europe .
"According to the above , this seems like the next logical step so that users can affordably use Maker ’ s vaults ."
These voters should see a transaction from this address : Address 0xec405bcd169633c0d8edc8ef869e164e42b9ec1e | Etherscan Provided ample time for execution before the startTime .
"Although there is some content on the site , most material simply links to other sites ."
A comment here on the decision to not allow stETH borrowing ; The decision was taken by the Lido team at the time the proposal was created to avoid introducing further risk of unforeseen attack surfaces .
The ideal user is someone who is using the product generate yield over a long period of time .

Supplying COMP to the protocol is one of the use cases of the token and giving rewards for this would incentivize people to hold on to the token .
"I view the success metrics as those outlined in the initial AGD proposal : Number of long term contributors to Aave that were initially funded with grants Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter over quarter Growth in the number of projects , ideas , and events funded Growth in community engagement ( e.g ."

"Justification First and foremost , I ’ d like to say that the industry is in a talent crunch , and Compound is in dire need of talent and of people bold enough to continue pushing ourselves past our current limits and assumptions ."
"Again , in trad banking , this would be similar to issuing Common Equity Tier 1 capital , Alternative Tier 1 capital ( like convertible hybrids ) , Tier 2 capital ( some form of redeemable senior debt ) ."
"I can ’ t support a proposal of this type with that budget , due to the following : Llama is an entity collaborating with other DAOs , so the collaboration is not exclusive ."
"The Certora Prover integrates into CI/CD so after every change in the code , similar to regression testing , the rules are re verified that the new code is still correct The Certora Prover ’ s primary purpose is finding bugs during development , rather than proving their absence ( although a successful verification also shows that a protocol takes safety and security seriously ) ."
Thanks !
Recourse here is further enhanced by the strength of Confessions of Judgment .
This was set at 50 percent via a multisig txn on March 21st 2022 but is due to return to the previously set 10 percent discount upon implementation of V2 .
I appreciate you bringing it up and sharing your perspective from similar initiatives .
"The universities we interviewed include Michigan , Columbia , Stanford , UCLA , Berkeley , and UChicago ."
I ’ m supportive of the adjusted scope and am excited to see this proposal going for a vote .
I agree with @ monet supply characterization on Bankless : MakerDAO ’ s RWA protocol is akin to a token bridge .
"Today , MKR holders do not have any options when allocating work to teams , and this model takes the first steps to change that paradigm ."
"To obviate credit risk , MakerDAO loans are : Overcollateralized : crypto collateral in Maker vault > DAI loan principal outstanding Self Liquidating : if crypto collateral depreciates , it will automatically be auctioned unless the user deposits additional collateral to satisfy the protocol ’ s overcollateralization ."

guil lambert : We specifically tried to choose pools that didn ’ t have the most TVL for that given pair so that the fee switch would not impact the majority of the deployed capital .
Burning MKR is like saying we don ’ t know how to reinvest in future growth so we will simply give money back to our investors .
Who are the signers ?
@ EzR3aL The motivation of this proposal is to reduce exposure to a multichain bridge .
I recognize I may not be as well informed as many here but I have genuinely tried to read and understand many of the proposals .
"Thank you , let ’ s do this !"
Would it be kept in DAI ?
I know @ samkazemian doesn ’ t like this sort of thinking but the FXS rewards in the gauge are 0 sum .
In open source
First the very first MetaDAO a major challenge will be to attract workforce talent that is willing to make the jump into a new unknown structure .
"a simple example , if GHO is over peg , minting DAI to short it ( a new PSM ? )"
"If threshold not achieved due to multiple candidate , then a run off process can be utilized ."
"Yieldgate is a recipient of the Aave Grant Foundation and also received further grants from The Graph , Toucan Protocol , etc ."
"Also want to highlight that the higher the temporary depeg , the wider arbitrage opportunity it creates ( i.e ."
Where is the transparency around DAO spending ?
Because burning for a few weeks is just a fraction of what was promised and expected .
The corresponding USD denominated line of credit is issued .
"If you wish , you may help organize it , structure its agenda , lead it , etc ."
"Thus , no encreased earning to reserves ."
"Ratification Poll for Facilitators Offboarding ( MDS 001 ) ( MIP41c5 SP5 )   March 14 , 2022 Voted Yes Related Core Value : Pragmatic Conflict of Interest : N/A –MDS ’ s role is more symbolic and it makes sense to offboard it and allow other CU or third party to take it over ."
b ) Other rights and remedies as may be determined in the Servicing Agreement .
AAVE and Balancer have been close partners for awhile now and I think a continuation of that can only lead to great things .
"Same Roles : Attendees : community in collaboration mode , MKR holders , CU members ."
"The resultant benefit for borrowers on Fringe Finance is that they have access to deep , unfragmented capital pools from which to borrow ."
The nature of these funds means that the end collateral and investments are more diversified than direct loans to subject borrowers with risk diluted across a wider base .
There is no question that Compound is paying a very large sum of money each quarter to Gauntlet .
"Governance , Decision Making and Control Expected Credit Loss Implementation Details RWA Foundation Operational Cost Estimates Appendices Risk : Onboarding Protocol Parameters ( On Chain ) Stability Fee ( duty ) : 0 Onchain Liquidation Ratio ( mat ) : 100 percent Debt Ceiling ( line ) : 100,000,000 Agreement duration/maturity date : N/A Oracle price ( pip/ds value ) : 100,000,000 Debt write off timelock ( tau ) : 0 Hash of party 's agreement with MakerDAO ( doc ) : 4bd1e783ec95ee7f2e11aad0b75af105 Recipient address of Dai : Genesis ETH address forthcoming Liquidation Process : MIP21c3 Key Transaction Terms Table Term Figure Description Debt Ceiling 100MM DAI Expected deployment over 12 18 months ."
Polygon will also be a rollup and a true L2 solution .
"In parallel with 3 ) , some improvements are to be applied to all v3 instances , including an audit pre deployment ."
"Along with the main conference , we hosted a side event with aligned partners to better engage with attendees and connect our communities ."
"To borrow language from the Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin announcement , we hope for this initiative to fund “ bounties , hackathons , and grants ” for “ developers , designers , community organizers and other web3 builders ” working on multi chain projects which improve , extend , promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross chain manner ."
This was answered in the other post made ( and on the discord ) .
"The proposed maximum borrow rate of 1000 percent corresponds to a weekly cost 4.7 percent ( daily cost of 0.66 percent ) , and corresponding supply rates at 100 percent utilization would be 800 percent per year ( 4.3 percent per week , 0.6 percent per day ) ."
What is the process ?

GREAT PROPOSAL !
What ’ s the question of the day ?

"I understand that running validators will require offchain , real world infrastructure ."
"If the DAO continues to hold the aCRV holding , then the bad debt is essentially recovered through interest earned by the DAO ."
Of course there is a cost for deleverage and you might actually want to wait ( even during negative APY ) for better market conditions for the actions .

Summary This proposal is created to further support the mission of a Multichain Uniswap .
I would add a few issues for consideration on this thread .
"Currently , UNI as an asset doesn ’ t directly contribute to Uniswap ’ s product – the DEX – in any analogous way ."
RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both ( a ) insures and ( b ) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol .

"Subject to the trustee ’ s customary practice , the trustee ’ s internal counsel may provide a confirmation of the same ."
I definitely wouldn ’ t mind getting in touch to discuss how some of this relates to Maker .

Anzen is a reserve pool that provides default protection for portfolios of private credit assets .
There are a few important points we would like to highlight and provide thoughts around : We believe the risk council should comprise of the parties/individuals with the most intimate knowledge of the protocol and security expertise .
( i.e .
"Benqi ’ s safety is largely in part to Chaos ’ s contributions across not only lending market risk alongside Gauntlet , but also various other fronts such as liquid staking and the veQI launch ."

The goal would be something that can be used by proposal authors to check for integration issues .
I merely wanted to kick off the discussion .
Integrate closely with Scroll ’ s rapidly growing ecosystem .
Thank you !
P.S .
Small example but demonstrates that there are pockets of ETH liquidity across AMMs and of course the liquidity in Cexes .
There are a lot of benefits to allowing a more flexible approach especially with services that are more likely to be temporary .
"As always , we are happy to discuss and answer any questions ."
The token unlock and distribution schedules can be seen here .
"We ’ d add that there ’ s a non zero risk of liquidation cascades from people having to deleverage under high ETH utilization , creating more market uncertainties ."
"If the community signals support , Gauntlet and Llama will follow up with implementation details ."
I didn ’ t see them there but I might have been looking in the wrong place .
"Instead , using the Aave Treasury provides a diversity of assets to cover the shortfall , shows the DAOs alignment with users of the Protocol and provides a far lower technical barrier and a quicker solution ."
"Risk parameter updates have been posted by Gauntlet , suggesting the adjustment of one parameter for one asset ( COMP ) in V3 ."
"Implementation of an ad hoc test suite , specifically targeting a “ hot ” upgrade like this : both v2 and v3 have extensive test suites , but the implementation of this upgrade would lead to something in the middle , which should be itself tested ."
"This is further exacerbated by the continuous nature of Maker governance : if all budget decisions were made at the same time , it would automatically force decision makers to zoom out & take a holistic view of the budget ; instead , budget requests are streaming in every a week , and every decision is made without taking all other budgets in mind ."
"If folks know of other PoW secured EVMs that should be considered alongside syscoin , feel free to add them here ."
Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into why Gauntlet is making specific parameter recommendations .
MIM recieved during this period was deposited into MIM+3CRV with the LP token deposited with Convex so that treasury could gain benefits from farming the position .

Those fees get returned to the protocol through buybacks .
"First , there are multiple PSMs , not just one ."
"In November 2020 , the Dai liquidation occurred ."
So if you have 200 MKR signal for A > B > C > D And then you have 100 MKR signal for D > A Then you get A ( 200 + 90 ) > D ( 140 + 100 ) > B ( 180 ) > C ( 160 ) ( I may have messed up the math here ) .
"The USDC market has been live for over 2 months now , and undergone 4 governance proposals ( 116 , 124 , 128 , 132 ) ."
What might happen if Uniswap generates fees from a pool that contains an asset designated as a security ?
Would Gauntlet be open to take the full payment in USD stables ?
Things like this make us move forward .
"IF all the selling pressure , happening on FXS during the contraction phase , can be absorbed by FXS ’ s earnings that the protocol had in the past or can produce hiking IR to the OCR value in the present , we can now understand how a “ sort of ” floor is created ."

Governance Participation The UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance .
The table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal .
This table does not present production in prior periods or production from other business areas of HVBank such as the residential mortgage division .
I ’ d like to voice my support for this proposal after revisions were made based on community feedback .
Understanding developer experience starts with realizing that software development platforms are multi layered technical products and that software engineers are their users .
"krzkaczor : MKR burn of around 1 percent yearly didn ’ t have any effect on the price , Is this necessarily true ?"
Totally Agree !
· Financial Flexibility/Debt Capacity .
"In addition , the AAVE treasury contains 1 ’ 843 ’ 000 AAVE , which is currently being distributed mainly on liquidity mining for both the protocol and the Safety Module ."
"Hi all , I am a bit surprised by the excessive decision ."
Thanks a lot for these risk parameters suggestions .
For them to be able to do this from day 1 we will need to have a good amount of liquidity .
I wanted to raise one more item here .
"Best in class Vyper Tooling and Integrations For v3 , Yearn contributors has decided to double down on developing their protocol using components written in Vyper ."

"At the outset , Anzen will cover “ blended notes ” , which are each a basket of assets instead of single assets ."
"It would be especially useful since current rewards for Curve pools are determined and fixed through the bi weekly vlCVX gauge voting process.This would also benefit vKP3Rs as users entering pools where off peg would earn rKP3R and redeem , creating additional OLM revenues which are directed back to vKP3Rs via fee payment ."
Okay thanks .
"If so , would this creator metadao have any part in its creation ?"
Looking forward to V3 on mainnet !
I will oppose any dilution now ~ !
I support this proposal ; Aave V3 is an important milestone in the evolution of the Aave protocol .
"The change is relatively simple in terms of code , but the validations have been really extensive , as it involves the movement of the most critical permissions of Aave from some smart contracts to others ."
My personal view is that the on chain text takes precedence over an off chain document that ’ s linked since that wouldn ’ t be immutable .
"In the second stage , all the available constitution drafts should be sent to a vote for MKR holders to choose from ."
"Rather than build on legal contracts , the next slew of start ups will embed such assets into smart contracts ."
Currency mismatch It should be noted that not all borrowers on RWA pools will want to necessarily take loans in FRAX .
This is especially true if we assume a scenario where the assets affected by the exploit would not be backed back by Harmony .
Maintenance of market share requires exhaustive use of resources .

Governance Proposal 14 is live .
"While some listing proposals such as MATIC are still moving forward , tokenholders should vote with an awareness that integration risks are always present ."
"In addition there are material upfront investment requirements on both parties to start such a set of repeating games , which strongly discourages anybody entering this “ credit game ” for a single game “ I win/you lose ” payout situation   which still would contain credible sanction options at the end of it ( broken market reputation ) ."
I will emphasize @ EzR3aL ’ s concern above : EzR3aL : Just yesterday we saw again what can happen if a bridge gets hacked/bug abused .
However as for second part i want to point one specific thing .
We can capitalize on the rising rate environment to pick off strategic assets and reward their operators via financial incentives .
"$ 4M/Year At present , it has done a good job and optimized the assets listing process ."
"Process and Capabilities Identify and quantify risks and exposures Breakdown the risks from quantitative to qualitative Develop models for quantitative risks and exposures , rank and order the qualitative and operational risks Develop a comprehensive scenario analysis framework including but not limited to simulating transaction and gas fee increases , decreases in liquidity by the protocol and pool level , and collateral risks Identification of market risks and sentiment risk factor that could cause a degradation of the confidence of the un collateralized portion of Frax and cause a potential de pegging event Simulation tooling allowing users to run their own custom historical , pre defined , or monte carlo simulations Quantification and modeling of a Frax reserve and when to intervene with the reserve depending on market conditions , volatility , and Frax confidence Quantification and understanding of how the risks change as Frax scales in size and is incorporated into new protocols and exchanges including potential market impact modeling Develop real time identification and monitoring of potential de pegging threats and events through on chain analytics Quantify the market for Frax according to different risk levels such as normal , medium , high and critical and have scenarios prepared and identified ahead of time to mitigate any potential de pegging events ; documenting risk mitigation steps ahead of time for each scenario Emerging threat identification and risk mitigation strategies such as a market collusion for a run on the peg event Catastrophic risk Insurance : Could de pegging catastrophe insurance be part of the solution and risk mitigation strategy ( Potentially even creating the catastrophe insurance market itself ) Systemic and event risk identification ."

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony .
A quote from morningstar : “ Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and all other closed end funds lack this flexibility .
"There have been multiple single days with price drops of 20 percent or more in probably every non stable asset in crypto , so for a staker deciding whether to panic sell or not this is not a very high bar to hit during these not infrequent worst days ."
"A 20 percent fee , would mean an APY of 8 percent ."
I believe this would be Compound ’ s first significant direct expenditure of stablecoin reserves outside of Proposal 59 ( DAI liquidation reimbursement ) and the first time reserves would be used directly to compensate contributors for their labor .
"about $ 27m has been borrowed from the pool also , the AMO is controlling the supply of FRAX to keep the APR percent in a set range to make it competitive ."
"Ni ortodoxa , ni heterodoxa ."

Sort of the community equivalent of “ looking somebody in the eyes ” and determining if one thinks one can trust the applicant Asset Manager “ setup ” designed for long term relationships with Maker ?
Big up this proposal !
How much ?
"If this proposal passes , GFX will become the tip of the spear and push efforts everywhere necessary to re establish the protocol in a dominant market position ."
BGD will have the freedom to come up with other developments to the Aave ecosystem if new needs appear during the engagement .
Cross Core Unit collaboration would be structured in a more robust and mature implementation .

"If this is successful , we will put up an on chain vote on Tuesday , November 29 ."
I just meant that the idea of refactoring the veFXS structure so it was more appealing to smaller fish had been discussed .
This dilutes attention from the community as we have limited time .
And if we don ’ t agree on certain subjects — we are close enough that our differences can be settled .
It is highly likely that running it will result in reverted transactions and EVM gas wasted as a result of losing the battle to better running searchers ( more on front running ) .
Many newer tokens have a majority of liquidity concentrated on V3   would hate to see low liquidity on V2 be an attack vector or a barrier to asset listing .

Not easy to find info on the FF project .
"85 percent is still probably too high , being the same as ETH , and factually only done to have some more protection on the current opened position , which is not really a valid rationale if it doesn ’ t protect against an important system wide risk ."
Plan to move this forward to a vote today .
Well thats exactly what I said just 100 times more eloquently presented .
shouldn ’ t it be bare minimum compensation ?

The operational aspects of this proposal are… daunting .
Were the upcoming legal restrictions taken into consideration ?
Monetalis MIP65 is pushing ( almost done ! )
The deal should be on the footing that Frax is bringing more value to the table by putting actual capital at risk when FST is just putting up governance tokens .
"My expectation was that these RWA MIP6 applications would at least undergo some form of prescreening for suitability by the sourcer or via some other well defined process or group ( not RWF per se since this would put RWF as gatekeeper to AO Maker access imo ) before these MIP6 were presented to governance to ‘ intent to onboard ’ MIP6 applications which would lead to formal RWF assessor , risk and legal reviews ."

"Lastly , a generic comment on gas costs/efficiency : since the Uniswap community is currently intending to use cross chain community solely for message passing the parameter updates ( see paragraph on what cross chain governance means above ) , it is not necessary to wait for the adoption of either threshold signature schemes or more sophisticated zero knowledge proofs ."

it ’ s probably also worth noting that stopping rKP3R rewards to vKP3R has likely had an impact in decreased revenues from OLM for the protocol since this is impacted by two factors ; a ) the price of KP3R which will heavily impact the revenue received from rKP3R redemptions since lower price will mean lower revenues & higher price will mean increase in revenues assuming the same volume of redemptions b ) volume of redemptions which is directly impacted by a reduction in the amount of outstanding or new rKP3R issued .

The fact that its not hardcoded is a positive in some factors… Since they can take a look at the market to see what APY people are expecting for that asset class and use that when determining fees as well… I think a reasonable base goal should be at least 1 percent net apy per asset ( stablecoin ) that is and hopefully near aave so yearn is the easier choice with more exposure to different baskets but a similiar yield to aave etc…

The Reserve protocol ( GitHub   reserve protocol/protocol ) is building on Aave by ( a ) integrating aTokens as collateral and ( b ) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions ( if listed on Aave as borrowable asset ) .
Altering the rules regularly for “ the greater good ” is a slippery slope and current ETH depositors/borrowers might frown at the Aave protocol changing the “ deal ” mid game drastically .
We can argue whether or not this is actually productive growth for a protocol but I think it ’ s clear that demand likely exists for leveraged / derivative products .
This looks awesome .

However I believe that asking Aave holders to vote weekly on gauges and optimize the DAO votes might not be the best way as it would create a precedent hard to change when/if the DAO veTokens holdings becomes critical in the rewards distribution .
"Goal : Explore Research Driven Insights for Maker Governance Our goal is to see if insights from the long running study of “ physical world ” governance are relevant for DAO governance and can help Maker as it thinks about new governance solutions in the context of the clean money vision , the Sagittarius engine , and the natural evolution of the DAO ."
"We encourage the community to discuss this further and would welcome input from community contributors , as there are numerous community driven options , including bringing this to the regular V3 market using the relevant security measures such as isolation mode , or launching a new V3 AMM Market ."
Remove all protocol owned liquidity and all protocol ownership of wrapped bridge FRAX & bridged FXS on every chain .
I think @ seba has it right that a smaller amount of FXS makes sense   this could be done by pairing up to $ 500K of treasury FXS with an amount paired with our initially farmed ROWAN and then as our farmed ROWAN grows in certain sized batches over time allowing DCA .

No .
Reserve factors should be optimized to balance protocol revenue and liquidity .

"Trust minimized Governance : Per Uniswap ’ s goal of becoming a multi chain protocol while remaining trust minimized , we propose using Nomad ’ s trust minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam ."
Wouldn ’ t these tasks be best completed by the Uniswap team rather than the foundation given that they have more experience on this as the founding members of the protocol ?
"While we encourage the facilitator candidates to already start operating as if they already running an official core unit as early as possible so that they can hit the ground running , we ’ re targeting the November cycle to make the formal proposals ."

What are some UGP success stories ?
What is UF ’ s relationship with Uniswap Labs ?
Identifying ( and funding ) Value It is challenging for MKR holders to steer the ship through the currently available governance tools .
"This proposal increases the surface area , so I can ’ t necessarily agree with the point that “ ( sic ) …party ( s ) at risk are stkMKR holders ” ."
We initially proposed a security budget of $ 100M based on the safety module size   it was the max slashing value of the safety module ( 30 percent of $ 300M ) and hence was theoretically ‘ what Aave could pay for ’ from what has been dedicated as a fund for insolvencies/coverage .

"To summarize : our analysis predicts that the impact of lowering MKR borrow limit , from a market risk perspective , is likely to be minimal ."
I hope they will be getting all the banking licenses together .
this proposal is not for killing the pool it simply will have a unlock period

"Compound III is still in a preliminary testing phase with limited supply caps ; I would like to contribute the following thought : If Compound III is demonstrated to be more efficient , it may make sense to migrate reserves ( from a version of the protocol with excess reserves ) to a version with too few reserves–or deployments on multiple blockchains ."
"As Uniswap develops into a multi chain ecosystem , we want to support developers working to create high quality multichain apps building on top of Uniswap , and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users ."
"The differences between both proposals highlighted by Matthew are important if it comes down to choosing between both implementations ( I assume listing both native BPTs and Aura BPTs are possible , but it likely leads to a confusing UX ) ."

"Right now veFXS holders get about $ 120k a week and the protocol earns about $ 700k , so the veFXS holders get about 17 percent of the protocol earnings , if this proposal was changed to allocated 15 percent of the AMO earnings to veFXS rewards then i would have no major issues with the proposal as it keeps the direct link between protocol earnings and veFXS rewards ."
"I think it ’ s a way to mitigate V2 risk and offer an opportunity to use V3 to make some of these assets come back with tailored caps , helping V3 adoption ."

"Further , exchanges are a natural target for regulatory scrutiny—they ’ ll be sensitive to KYC/AML issues ."
"Voting : Yes , grant Hermes DeFi an Additional Use Grant License ."
This would ease concern over the risk of $ FRAX to the market and would completely disincentivize anyone from attacking the protocol .
The very existence of cryptoassets and their persistent could serve as an indicator that this trend is already being tested in the other direction .

The junior tranche will capture the residual cash flows in the pool after the senior investors have been fully paid back .
This would mirror other existing loan syndication or partnership programs like the SBA or Main Street Lending programs .
The liquidity can be used to meet immediate liquidity requirements of cross border payment providers .
Even things to be added .
"We have analyzed the Uniswap largest pools , and most of the liquidity provided is done by a few actors , some of which are providing liquidity although they are out of range = ( see : 161944 ( USDC/ETH 0.3 percent ) 9M 368120 ( USDC/ETH 0.3 percent ) 10M 314029 ( USDC/ETH 0.3 percent ) 6M 259042 ( USDC/ETH 0.3 percent ) 12M More than 20 percent of the pool is filled by 4 LP 360541 ( USDC/ETH 1 percent ) 10M 50 percent of the pool is filled by one LP   Maybe good to ask him if ok   But I guess as you guys chose that pool you probably have already discussed with them ."
"Thanks again for your comments , @ hexonaut   PE , @ Nadia   Growth , @ Aes   SF , and the many other community members are exploring opportunities holistically to sustain the evolution of $ DAI ."
"Perhaps it ’ s the expectation they can earn a higher yield up front vs accruing through the auction mechanism as protocols may be inclined to overpay for growth , maybe not a bad assumption , but perhaps the bidding RWA protocols would then be incentivized to approve riskier opportunities to recoup funds ."

It would be better to task an internal or external party with executing the trades in a discretionary way .
There might be some frontend module integration needed that we can closely work with the Uniswap team to complete .

I personally proposed the idea of a partnership and token swap between ANGLE and FRAX last year and it was widely rejected by ANGLE members before it even got to the governance proposal stage .
And yet they not even were able to push airdrop through governance .

this has been implemented in the new vaults interface Yearn Vaults Screenshot 2022 12 21 at 16.38.31856×266 8.31 KB
Interviews with various proposal creators and governance participants in the Uniswap ecosystem have yielded some evidence that the current intensiveness of the governance process is a barrier to proposal creation .
The selection of Nomad by the reputable Gnosis Chain and Moonbeam teams earlier this year indicated to us that migrating all of Uniswap ’ s cross chain governance platform to a single partner could be a win for Uniswap .
"While our latest version of the jump rate model with its current parameters works okay for stablecoins , they are far from optimal for other markets ."

This multisig would receive the non invasive permissions described in the previous section .
"this leads me to think most loans that other investors dont want to fund will be backed by higher risk assets , meaning the FRAX funded loans will take on the biggest risks ."
"From its inception , LayerZero was designed to provide protocols like Uniswap with a unified interface across all chains ( both EVM and non EVM ) ."
"On the other hand , decreasing the voting power of routinely inactive delegates could incentivize participation ."

If there is $ 100m FRAX locked in the pool for an average of 2 years then the assets backing that 100m FRAX ( $ 89.5m non frax stables ) could be loaned out to RWA protocols with the condition that FRAX protocol can recall the assets before the 2 years ends .
"For larger grants , we typically have three payment tranches : an upfront payment , a payment on completion of the first milestone , and a payment on the completion of the project ."
We had previously mentioned the possibility of offering FV security services but that never materialized in our existing proposal since there was no active FV vendor at the time .
An example of this would be Lemon Cash .
"Initially , we were thinking about re using the existing static aTokens of Aave Ethereum ( wrapped aTokens not increasing in balance but in value ) as an extra layer of composability , to be deposited into a relatively simple bridge ."
And in my opinion there is no need anymore for a grant for someone who is already working for months/years with Aave .
Upon removal the role holder will receive compensation up to the end of current month in which removal vote is decided .
"Going back to something mentioned before , one of the entities holding AAVE voting power at the moment but incapable to vote is the AAVE ecosystem reserve , which has 10.7 percent of the supply or 1 ’ 700 ’ 000 AAVE ."

Why the Incubation Program ?
…thanks btw for the ad hominem when I ’ m just giving constructive feedback
Even the agreement income of uniswap itself can not be enjoyed !
BD and relentless shipping have long been the outperforming strength of the Frax team   but just a few extra key integrations and partnerships could be worth 10 ’ s of millions .
We are also the only team that was able to formally verify interesting security properties including preservation of funds .
Feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to answer them
"I have to read this in piecemeal but , while I am not admitted in Pennsylvania , having a confession of judgment is generally ideal to have in your pocket ."
Adding FRAX as an asset would obviously be the preferred course .
"If they are under collateralized with for example 80 percent of the value of the ib * * * tokens , I still think it would be best to make it possible for ib * * * holders to redeem their tokens for 80 percent of the value , rather than not being able to use the system at all like it is now ."
"Separately , have a few tidbits of feedback myself… inkyamze : Communicating more directly with key stakeholders than the community In my opinion , this is the biggest improvement that Gauntlet can make ."

This can be determined through decrease in volume of redemptions since the end of weekly rKP3R rewards to vKP3R w/c 14th March to present ( compared to period prior ) We therefore believe that focus in this area should be in promoting demand for KP3R at the same time balancing demand with scarcity through new vested locks would lead to an expectation of positive price action .
"And from there , request “ quotes ” or proposals from reputable firms in the specific field ."
Lots to look at and consider .
"The period of time for the DAO to earn enough aCRV from interest payments on its aCRV holding was around 80 days a week ago , it is now 225 days and with v3 + normal borrowing conditions enabled , we expect it will probably come down from 225 days ."
They are making all right moves in bridging gap between real world finance and DeFi .
"With total borrowings equal to the status quo scenario , but less assets supplied , this pushes up utilization rate and results in a smaller drop in reserve growth versus status quo scenario ( $ 630,000 less revenue per year , a 26 percent drop ) ."

I guess I am trying to figure out how tax compliance is handled because I see no intermediary in a tax neutral jurisdiction for the fund flow of DAI ( with taxable profits presumably ) back to Maker .

"We ’ re aiming to build a long lasting organization that makes Ethereum ’ s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation ’ s existing efforts , and reducing the ecosystem ’ s reliance on any one organization for development platform components ."
"In this second stage of the ‘ revised governance model ’ , we are submitting this temperature check as a 5 day snapshot vote ."

"The stability fee for vaults used for farming could be dynamically increased to capture some of the value of the free MZR tokens , by for instance setting it to its base rate + 20 percent of the APY provided by the MZR farm ."
Hopefully such a proposal gives them a north they ’ ve been searching .
We expect more Core Units to adopt the tools we have created : Is your Core Unit not using the Budget tool yet ?
"Like if I offered a group of people to choose between red socks and blue socks , I wouldn ’ t say this “ aligns them equally to blue socks , according to their own preferences ” ."
Trust that the MakerDAO protocol is secure .
"If the community were to show a desire to list the mentioned collateral type on a V3 AMM on Ethereum then this would add an extra step , which would involve launching the V3 AMM ."
This protocol fee test appears as of yet incompletely defined .
"This may be important for the app users , but from this partnership proposal the most important thing for FRAX is not doing prison time for creating an illegal betting app ."
I want to thank @ Andy_McCall @ Allan_Pedersen for their comments .
What matters is that we focus deeply on the systemic ones .
Can you clarify what is meant by “ Third Party Liquidity ” ?
Decentralization of ownership matters .
This is now live on the governance manual here .
"Seems to be an early instance of these teams overlapping , hence the passionate debate ."
"This makes things more attractive for users , increasing TVL , demand etc ."
I think this is actually the factor that may end up being the biggest wildcard of all .
"USDC , wBTC , USDP each account for over 500M worth of collateral ."
"your asking for a partnership , Maybe you would like to let us know who you are or whos in your team ?"
What I like in particular is that this approach is much more decentralized than the CU approach .
"Without this attributability , further research is definitely needed to correctly incentivize participants ."
i guess this is a way to direct some of the gauge rewards in long term holders hands .
"We can see change in market efficiency , measured by spread between borrow and supply rates , in the below chart ."
We have great people working behind the scenes .
I didn ’ t realize that ’ s how it was being calculated .
But the original declaration of intent is more on the 2 yr side ( because it made sense when it was written ) and we are not launching tomorrow which mean short term yield can fall and make this product bad ( meaning cost > expected return ) when we we would launch .
JustinCase : And not burning is saying you know how to invest better than the people who invested in you in the first place .
That is the entirety and will be the only available features .
Not huge all things considered but not insignificant either .
"As a intro , I would check out the blue pill https : //thebluepill.eth.link and how we think about Yearn ."
"All though the risk levels seem bearable , I support some precautionary measures to mitigate risks of deterioration The StETH market is highly concentrated on weakened users : The top 10 holders supply 70 percent of the liquidity Celsius , currently under liquidity crush suspending activity , is Aave ’ s top stETH liquidity supplier with 28 percent of the pool ; they user stETH as collateral with 20 percent WBTC Aave ’ s risk mitigation can not rely on trusting users Curve.fi ETH/sthETH shares stETH exit liquidity on Curve.Fi is reducing : Share of ETH dropped to 20 percent lack of liquidity may prevent liquidations lack of liquidity may further stress the peg if this liquidity pool dries out , depositing on Aave and borrowing against would become one of the last options to get liquidity of StETH holders I am in full support freezing the stETH market to contain Aave protocol ’ s exposures as stETH is already one of the most popular collaterals , with active borrowings against > $ 1B of stETH ."
I think that part of the successes of KP3R has been the constant education material shared by this non tech content/customer service team .
Specifications Link between the author & the project : the author of this ARC is part of the core team of Reserve in the function of Community Manager .
"In general to me the potential risk of losing competitivity isnt relevant : Borrowing should be reenabled immediately after the merge ( and I hope gauntlet will plan the proposal to reactivate it accordingly ) As people withdraw , apy will take care of itself ."
I do want to call out that borrowing interest rates can not be controlled by the DAO .
Great thinking as always and keep it coming !
There are community developers there and they are happy to answer technical questions and share their knowledge of liquidations .
Participation in tasks .
Further information about the technicalities can be found on the repository containing the proposal ’ s payload implementation here .
It includes the other budget modifications we are asking for as well .
"In essence , while there are operational and technical risks , the real challenges for Frax is the liquidity mismatch problem as you mention ."
RWAC believes this role offers increasing value to MakerDAO as real asset lending scales .
HVBank will retain a minimum of fifty percent ( 50 percent ) ownership in the principal of the HVBank Participated Loans .
Revolutionizing RWA in DeFi with MakerDAO was only a part time activity .
"There is a strong reason very sophisticated regulators have been continuously pushed towards simplification in tiering capital reaching the point that if it ’ s cash is good , if it ’ s not cash , it should be heavily discounted because its correlation with other assets in moments of crisis is all TBC ."
Don ’ t want to make this a discussion on whether it is feasible or not ( I am posting this because I think I have a feasible approach ) .
How the AMM is funded ?
"One last area or possibly pillar that I think might be worth adding , even though is still years away , is a bucket for private crypto investments vetted by SFU and approved by MKR holders ."
Thanks to Llama community for this thoughtful proposal .
It will help Futureswap by creating more liquidity while effectively pricing FST in FRAX and making Fraxswap the main venue for FST liquidity .
Bridge Security Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing ?
"The appropriate answer for Maker , as a decentralized protocol , may be anywhere along the spectrum of “ totally hands off other than liquidation ” to “ totally hands on this is risky ” ."
WIN WIN .
If GHO is backed by stkAAVE would the token lose its backing and peg ?
1181×807 130 KB The above is an attempt to provide an abstraction of the risk reward space for such a mechanism .
"To have something more solid , Compound should be more of a DAO , which owns value , manages it , and is profitable in growing protocol owned funds ."
How are these risks managed within the Goldfinch and TrueFi AMOs ?
All vesting contracts are publicly available on chain .
Are you benchmarking against the private ABL market ?
"For growth , how about new currencies ( EUR ) or asset types ( Gold ) to peg to ?"
Do you know which custodian ( s ) wouldn ’ t work with Snapshot ?
"Securities , Markets , Accounting , etc ."
"What this means is that , should the MakerDAO community seek to wind down the vault due to cause ( broad deterioration , delinquency , default , collateral value drawdown etc ."
"The text in the on chain proposal , which was read and passed by COMP voters in December , specifically says “ quarterly payments ” which you can see in the governance dashboard and in the tx hash on chain ."
"Is it Trail of Bits , etc. , and what would they quote for similar services ?"
Also Fraxswap needs more battle testing .
I bought a 100 COMP and made the mini proposal .
"The platform has already seen > 50,000 users and 500,000 on chain transactions ."
"we appreciate llama optimization on premium , theses assets auctions from the protocol are basically “ slippage free ” winning trades and great opportunities for arb & Market markets , the ACI is supportive of more systemic integration of the auctions ( such as with DEX aggregators ) to make the clearing of it as fast and smooth as possible while optimizing the premium to make sure the DAO gets the best possible deal from it at the benefit of the protocol ."
It would definitely require us to think about competitiveness outside of the box of traditional corporations .
We believe working collaboratively with Llama on this integration and related processes will be beneficial to ensure full transparency and community engagement .
If you want to see anything else from the session that Figma link is open to view .
Uniswap does not have a business model and generates 0 revenue for its owners .
Aave is considering something similar .
"And if so , can guidance be provided ?"
They will sell in the Curve pool .
"What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified , if any ?"
He is the one who introduced me to Maker .
Great step especially with the market conditions and v3 around the corner .
"This feature prevents human error in future protocol upgrades that risk affecting every integrated application by default , and prevents attacks from the entity pushing the upgrade , regardless of the security of their off chain infrastructure ."
"This would be possible since UNI is already a collateral asset on Fringe , which has set the loan to value at 49 percent ."
"While USD is minted from the Fed it is actually very censorship resistant , especially in cash form ."
Who doesn ’ t ?
There is no risk only reward .
"Rather than a one off vote , this proposal seems like the beginning of a longer term discussion around how the Compound protocol ought to treat its reserve factors ."
"Due to the limited nature of this dialogue , we remain uncertain whether the views expressed are representative of full alignment of the multisig ."
"Obviously , this would make the model more complicated but arguably a better one for real world decision making ."
Access to trade credit as a supplemental source of financing .
Stronger and more diverse RWA collateral will feed the perception of a strong peg and so on and so forth… 1218×866 68.9 KB Decentralization : The PSM expanded access to DAI and bolstered its peg but sacrificed some decentralization ( resiliency really ) and potential yield .
"1inch Limit Order Protocol : 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders , and RFQ Orders , which later can be filled on chain ."
"As the Trust will owe it ’ s pro rata portion of taxes on the income coming off the underlying participations , WSFS will indeed pay them ."
Would be a great partnership

Check out all the other events happening in Uniswap Discord .
It ’ s great to see Other Internet taking such an active role in the ongoing evolution of Uniswap ’ s governance .
"Also , it has a very low fee for TRYB redemption ."
We don ’ t have RoE problems or dilution problems following regulation pushing us to issue Tier 2 or Alt Tier 1 instruments currently .
Decentralization of the Updater agent is a stated goal of Nomad ’ s .
"I personally think FRAX tokenomics are pretty good and FXS is good token thats likely to increase in value , so i would be attracted to the option of staking it and earning more FXS ."
"In practice , this may take the form of scheduled polls and evaluations ( either community wide or by a select committee ) at pre defined intervals , where these issues can be raised + a 6 month window for remediation ."
"However in return the MetaDAO will be collateralizing the risk of these adopted vaults , with maker extracting collateral from the MetaDAO to cover any losses it incurs from the adopted vaults ."
Our interests are aligned with those of the DAO .
Note : Polychain sponsored the proposal .
"Furthermore , there is a requirement to pay taxes in it ( which also drives demand ) ."
"Additional facets that will expand upon this codebase are the addition of lending markets , NFT staking , and The Hermes DeFi team is committed to transparency , and we will provide any and all information required to ensure that the legality , security , and ownership of this ecosystem is protected ."
"This means that Alphabet is a one size fits all strategy where the core of the company operates with a focus on steady growth and returns above all , while being supported by risky ventures that are fully autonomous , and are allowed to take major risks and to fail , but that also have the potential for outsized returns and even in theory , could match or even exceed the success of Google ."
We are tied to no chain which theoretically would makes us available to all of them .
I don ’ t think a higher LB is guaranteed to be beneficial for smoother liquidations .
"Use a smaller portion for Phase 1 , learn from that Phase , and then deploy more OP 1 ."
Then on the tracks : I thought there was also an idea for a RWA track/RWA core units ?
Very interesting .
I am still hesitant about rewarding this pool with emissions based rewards from the gauge rather than protocol profit based rewards that currently only go to veFXS holders .
"I think a more balanced approach of reducing liquidity risk from centralized assets ( eg LP token backing displacing PSMs ) , strong public engagement and advocacy for decentralized money , and willingness to sacrifice short term profit/burn/number go up to try to win greater ETH market share and decentralized collateral backing will be more effective ."
This proposal is truly designed as a pilot program intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution .
OpenZeppelin will verify sufficient simulations were performed as part of its proposal audits going forward .
"In 3 weeks , on Monday , December 12 , we will post a Snapshot poll for the community to vote on these changes ."
We are incredibly lucky that you have devoted your time and energy to Maker and GovAlpha .
Uniswap would certainly benefit from a more standardized solution for cross chain deployments .
"The beta phase will last 3 6 months + , or until we feel comfortable leaving beta ."
But it may be worth thinking through some of these issues at some point during the initial phases of this new process ( if you haven ’ t already ) .
One of our team members already wrote a simple PoC that would take the form of a Timelock like UpgradeRegressionManager .
"In addition , several users raised concerns about turning on the fee switch for the ETH Dai 5bps pool ."
It is not to MKR holders ’ benefit to defund essential projects .
[ AIP ] V3 Retroactive Funding Vote : YAE Aave v3 is the future and this proposal recognises the efforts of Aave Companies contribution to the community .
"Messari report on the DAI market1024×576 178 KB Source : https : //messari.io/article/state of compound q4 2021 In the past four quarters , net interest income for the DAI market was $ 22.3M , so my requested rate is about 13 percent of this ."
This will be built on the existing work of posts by Compound Labs and expanded to account for the challenges faced by third party contributions .
+1 Something needs to change
"TLDR ; Having a FRAX pool on Anzen will provide a sink or use case for Frax , with the aim of driving more Frax minting , and corresponding burning of FXS to its target collateral rate ."
"Over time , any collateral that meets this criteria would have to be accordingly backed by the same amount of DAI in the Surplus Buffer ."
BNB Chain ’ s support for on chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community driven development model .
"We could go to a Maximum of around 20 percent share of the pool to each at current TVL ( 8.5 and 5.4Ms respectively ) , if that would make sense ."
"For example , assume institutional users that need to identify their wallet or they can ’ t use the protocol ."
Has a16z gone through a similar analysis for other protocols that generate revenue for the protocol itself ?
This token is a good example for integration because it has an existing price oracle contract which is needed for Compound III collaterals .
We agree with the proposed 6 month cadence for on chain votes to evaluate and make changes to the council and its mandate .
"The stablecoin you want to HOLD : minimum depeg risk , aim is for 0 percent risk , currently USDC is the leader ."

"Furthermore , deep liquidity in MLP will allow for yield strategists such as Umami to build strategies on top of MLP that can be denominated in FRAX ."
"Previously , I was acting as CTO at the Aave Genesis Team , being one of the initial team members since pre Aave times ."
"It ’ s great to see the development , visualization , and inspiration behind some of the new features of V3 ."
RWA is a huge opportunity and Maker is one of the leading forces in that space .
"For example , it is impossible to make individual budget decisions for Maker without considering the budget of all CUs , Maker ’ s current recurring revenue and runway , overall market conditions , etc ."
"As the code is immutable , there has been no update since then ."
Why not use the future revenues of Maker to repay a bond ?
"In addition , we will be onboarding several RWA type lending opportunities over the coming months and if FRAX would like exposure to those types of opportunities , we are happy to present those , as well ."
"bgdlabs : If funds of the bridge are not backed by return of funds or the Harmony Network itself , the Aave community should start an analysis and a discussion if the Safety Module was supposed to cover Aave V3 Harmony or not yet ."
Will we be contacted by Uniswap team through our social media or community ?
"Before providing our parameter recommendations to adjust for Phase 2 , we wanted to take a step back and highlight some key takeaways from Phase 1 ."
"Given that deploying Uniswap V3 on other chains is mainly a strategic / product decision , not a quantitative one , Gauntlet will abstain from this vote ."
We can likely strike a balance where GFX Labs has some degree of autonomy in prioritizing deliverables while remaining accountable to governance during the streaming period .
"Abstract : Harmony is a quickly growing L1 blockchain with advanced technology that offers trustless bridges , 2 second transaction finality , and scalability using a sharded proof of stake mechanism ."
Anchor drove a lot of demand for stEth in the first place bc eth needed to be staked as stEth to be used as collateral there .
The real winner of the said competition is the Aave DAO .
"Democratic countries are slow in the development of policy , and despite years of warnings from folks like Marx and Mao , they have been far more successful in supporting the normative principles of liberalism than not ."
to make the top 5 you need a lot of votes so the options are to give 1 protocol a good chance of getting in or give a number of protocols a very slim chance .
We would be brain dead not to phase out rewards on Dai deposits once this goes live .
"On the UI the experience wont change much , you ’ ll just have a way to define transactions to be executed on different network when creating a proposal ."
"The fact that there is already enough protocol owned liquidity on Polygon making this pool somewhat meaningless , having extra room for incentives on other more useful gauge pools and an added risk of a de peg in these market conditions should at least be good enough to put it up for a vote ."
We make it clear to any protocol that can execute this strategy at scale in a safe way will be getting several billion in DAI loans at a reasonable rate .
I ’ d like to offer some constructive feedback .
"Title : [ ARC ] Repay excess debt in CRV market for Aave V2 ETH Status : Proposed Author : @ llamaxyz and Gauntlet Dated : 2022 11 23 Simple Summary Decide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market ( currently ~ $ 1.6M USD , dependent on CRV ’ s token price ) ."
"We think the most responsible timeline to initiate this proposal is some days after the Ethereum Merge , as any network disruption or lack of focus on AAVE voters would be harmful to the proposal ."
ETH market is a legacy one .
I ’ m inherently distrustful of anything that doesn ’ t seriously address downsides .
?
"Currently , the majority of the total borrowings of the pool ( 73 percent ) are still ONE ."
"Thanks to the Bretton Woods agreements , the value of the dollar continued to be the most important reference , so we can conclude that despite the bad decisions , the exhibition is the one that maintains the value of the dollar as an international reference , and that we must do with DAI so that be the reference value What is the right balance between decentralization and efficiency ?"
"Complicated topic , but after assessing pros/cons of keeping ETH borrowing enabled I ’ m in favor of stopping borrowing ."
"Gauntlet ’ s risk management marginal base fee is shown below : Below shows Gauntlet ’ s quarterly service fee denominated in COMP ( table calculated at $ 221.14 30 Day VWAP ) Currently ( as of 12 27 2021 ) , the 30 Day VWAP is $ 221.14 , the 30 day average borrow is $ 7.31B , and the number of assets on Compound is 16 ."
These are good and challenging questions .
"The pool does not have any kind of fee , other than any costs of moving UNI to Harmony ( 1UNI ) through the Harmony Bridge ."
These assets are not accepted as collateral which further reduces risk .
Staking WOO enables zero fee trading on WOO X .
Otherwise it is difficult to enforce has this ever been a problem ?

"The Autonomous Proposal has initiated 2 votes on the Aave governance : https : //app.aave.com/governance/proposal/ ? proposalId=106 The vote on the current Level 2 requirements , will factually update them if passing ."
Again I am not saying that Polygon shouldnt get compound I just think that L2 deployment should be also strongly considered because thats the future .
"Contrary to externally verified bridges , Nomad ’ s optimistic verification only requires “ 1 of n ” honest parties ( Watchers ) in the system to submit a fraud proof during a 30 minute window ."
"The Approvers , which are based on predetermined matrices with credit , dollar amount , and relationship exposure modalities , will either ( 1 ) approve the CLS as presented , ( 2 ) deny the CLS as presented , or ( 3 ) send the CLS to the loan originator and credit analyst with additional questions , comments , or suggestions ."
Technical Paper The GHO technical paper outlines the smart contract design of GHO .
It ’ s not clear to me how much a larger surplus mitigates execution risk .
"65K ( Current ) 50K 10K 1K 100 0 voters On January 14 , if the community decides that Compound ’ s proposal limit should reduce from the current 65K ( ~ $ 13M ) limit , we ( Blockchain at Berkeley ) will take the result from this poll and put up a proposal that changes the minimum proposal threshold to the community decided result ."
"As a part of Certora continuous formal verification activity , we have conducted a formal verification of stMATIC token code using our generic ERC20 token specification ."
"Week of September 26 , 2022 Summary It ’ s been a relatively quiet week here on the forums , even while Uniswap Labs has been traveling the world to attend conferences ."
"I also agree with @ Sirokko that the initial set of assets should be relatively minimal , to ease the governance decision making for launch ."
"We ’ ve seeded Uniswap and Curve EUROC/USDC pools , and DFX has already created their own EUROC/USDC pool ."
"We clearly address that fact , explaining the reasoning for our liquidity model : “ Unlike most major crypto assets , where significant liquidity is found on CeFi venues , stETH liquidity is mainly provided on Curve ."
Our pools are permissioned with all investors checked for AML and sanctions purposes .
At the end of this period we would submit a new proposal for the following quarter with an updated retainer fee calculation .
Many will just sell the Temple & FRAX what is obviously bad for the FRAX peg .

"[ ARC ] Risk Parameter Recommendations for Aave V2 ETH ( 2022 11 22 ) A month ago , as part of our risk off framework , we polled a number of community members ( including the Aave team and BGD ) about how much they thought the security budget of each market needed to be and came to a median number of roughly $ 100M ."
Should we raise RFs and incentivize supply with additional COMP instead ?
"One difference is that it ’ s not only about the US regulations ( a peg to USD will still trigger the EU regulations , for instance ) ."
"The node that is run on the local machine allows us to submit transactions as if they were legitimate , and we can examine the outcome to ensure our eventual changes will be proper ."
"What we are taking into account in the analysis is : The priority is to find solutions for all users ( apart from people doing the aforementioned arbitrage ) that could be affected , and keep protocol wide health , meaning no bad debt ."
"Projects review We initially talked to 3 teams : Abacus , Axelar and Nomad ."
"Aave has basically no control over bridge safety ( other than making the decision not to deploy on a particular chain like Harmony in the first place ) , and even with a proof of reserve oracle mechanism it is likely that markets would become insolvent based on existing cross collateralized positions ."
"In the instance that there was not enough idle $ USDC available , $ FXS would be minted and sold into the most liquid pool for $ USDC , paired with the collateral available , and returned to the redeemer at 1:1 ."
Nice !
"As part of the off chain simulations , Chaos Labs will run a massive number of Monte Carlo simulations to assess the protocol ’ s VaR per Market ( Chain ) and across markets ."
My concern here is with the implementation as a series of governance proposals at 28 day intervals .
"Specifically , ScopeLift specializes in Solidity smart contracts that have processed thousands of transactions on multiple platforms ."
"Governance at deployment will be facilitated by messaging bridge Optics Robert Leifke and Kyle Scott , members of Blockchain at Michigan , are co founders of Mobius , a Celo stableswap protocol ."
There is no risk only reward .
It would be ideal to find a team that is excited to create bespoke derivatives products for various Frax products .
Against : Do nothing .
Maker would be free to offer either fixed term or revolving credit facilities without impacting DAI holder UX .
The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain .
"if credit line runs out it ’ s the responsibility of the Port to settle their position if they wish to keep using portals , severe directional flux of transfers means settlement positions needs to happen more regularly and/or larger credit lines might be asked ."
"By focusing on future growth , the value of MKR should increase in the eyes of many investors ."
Maker needs to be anti fragile to survive .
Assets accepted for swaps in ?
Stablecoin liquidity ( among other things ) will be one of the primary targets for liquidity rewards due to the necessity of a healthy stablecoin market in any ecosystem which aims to gain mass adoption .
We are really welcoming Aave community ’ s feedback and would love to get challenged by the community in order to remove every piece of doubt .
Delegates and active token holders can help add value to the protocol within the limitations of their roles .

"[ ARC ] Aave V3 Fantom   Freeze reserves We voted YAE : “ The Fantom Aave V3 market did not gain noticeable traction with a current market size of 9M $ and 2.4M $ of open borrowing position , this led to a market generating on average 300 $ of fees daily for the protocol ( ~30 $ of daily fees for the Aave treasury ) ” Seeing that the Aave Fantom market has not been increasing , and the treasury is earning only $ 30 a day , the inherit costs associated with up keep and possible smart contract breach compromising Aave reputation just isn ’ t enough in our opinion to justify keeping this market live ."
"UX : From crypto loans to the PSM to the D3M , MakerDAO ’ s products are easy , convenient , and cheap to use ."
"About Neon EVM Neon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM ) built into a Solana smart contract , enabling Ethereum developers to build on Solana and access its native ecosystem without changing their codebases ."
This leaves withdrawals and liquidations in the cETH market effectively frozen while the issue remains in place .
Reasonable people can disagree
Esperemos que seamos varios con el entusiasmo de estar en la core unit .
Agree with this note–would look for a version of this proposal at a lower funding level
"The mechanism outlined in this proposal would make UNI a very relevant pair in Uniswap pools and hence an unforkable value add to the protocol ( adding liquidity , volume and TVL ) ."
tokens are distributed to various vaults according to the various weights defined by the index .
"In addition , the community may like to revisit the prioritization towards migrating from V2 to V3 ."
I can ’ t say enough how much I appreciate the idea behind all the work that has been and continues to be done on this protocol .

How does the UF plan on being sustainable over time ?
The next one is scheduled for July 27 at 2:00pm UTC or the one after that will be end of August .
People tend to vote more when they understand the decision they ’ re facing .
Unbonding also disincentivizes participation through centralized exchanges or other pooled staking services which could compromise MakerDAO decentralization .
Applications with high security standards have the choice to accept protocol enhancements or not .
Continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new projects / tools are rolling out on a continuous basis .
Why ?
thanks for this I will check it out Is there a contract we can look at to see what parameters are checked for wallets to receive voting power ?
The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer ’ s revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March .

"We also interviewed a number of Uniswap v3 LPs and recorded some key takeaways from those conversations as well as feedback from a targeted survey we distributed , which can be found in the appendix ."
Locked FRAX FXS Uni LP currently provides voting power on snapshot votes .
I believe that the lack of such a mechanism is part of the reason the MKR token price lags the value that the protocol generates .
Sequencer Rotation We would like to ask Metis team to point out the exact code that implements Sequencer Rotation and other mechanism mentioned in the documentation .
Let me rephrase .
"But each of these pools should track the same price and , by association , each pool should have the same properties , including the fees collected and the price ’ s realized volatility ."
"Probably a good long term move for frax , FXS holders will eventually benefit over a much longer timeframe"

Very cool .
"For a protocol based on “ trustlessness ” , this also becomes an important consideration ."
"This is from a AO contact to sourcer , sourcer helping put together a MIP6 , what it means for governance to pass or block a MIP6 , prioritization of MIP6 processing with RWF ( who controls this or how is it managed ) , and then assessment reports ( if a fail a process for AO , sourcer to appeal and/or to resubmit a MIP6 ) , etc ."
"From that base , we confirmed certain aspects and took some decisions : The Starknet ecosystem is growing at an exaggerated rhythm ( that is good ) , with tons of projects continuously developing cool solutions for any type of need ."
TL ; DR : Current market liquidity is very likely sufficient to handle expected liquidations in the protocol and no immediate parameter changes or risk mitigations are necessary .
Helping communities to retrieve stkAAVE rewards further encourages partners to work with Aave .
It would be great publicity for MakerDAO and generate a solid financial return while making a quantifiable social impact .
Will note that this is from the foundation rather than the DAO so there ’ s some small differences : We are currently optimising more for deep liquidity rather than profitability from a trading perspective so it ’ s not necessarily guaranteed to make income Given the foundation holds a lot less PERP than the DAO we are exploring under collateralised option .

"Thank you for putting this together @ Eumenes and @ christiancdpetersen , Yes , it is A LOT , but this document will work as a detailed guideline for any potential counterparty interested in working with Maker , and more importantly as a map for the CUs and the Community to translate what “ Investment Grade ” means in terms in practice ."
This could be used to either step on the gas or pull back in the future .
"If Maker had a vision , many strategic or tactical governance decisions would derive from them as well w/o the risk of falling back into the same fundamental debates over again ."

I believe that MKR token is currently priced solely on its fundamentals .
This is as @ guil lambert has suggested and this is key as it allows one to have some data to work with at last .
The possibility for information asymmetries is also dramatically reduced through MakerDAO ’ s open governance process .
Glad I saw this before I started to read
"Global Settlement In the event that Maker governance or MKR holders trigger global settlement , all outstanding debts are immediately settled against a proportional share of vault collateral assets ."
How does this align with the YFI Buyback initiative ?
I will continue with my crappy analogies as if they do anything : This feels like you ’ re are fixing an old coat you love   its got a big ole ’ hole in the elbow .
To make FXS 40 percent more scarce we would need to remove 40 percent of the total supply .
So the idea will be searching for the best dApps that offers this tokens ?

Current Risk Levels We have done some quick analysis to size the estimated potential loss Aave could experience if these accounts get liquidated and kick off a liquidation spiral .
The compensation for the previous lead was the max amount that could be paid .

"If Maker captured even a few percent of the floor capitalization of top collections , this could allow for minting tens of millions of DAI ."
"Currently the cCOMP borrow total is about 85,000 COMP , comfortably below the new 150,000 COMP borrow cap ."
This is crazy stuff and not even Solana did this .
"Perhaps the benefits aren ’ t sufficient to justify the extra gas , but curious about your thoughts on whether UAV V2 could play a role in mitigating the concentrated liquidity risks of V3 ."
Recently Fringe Finance has integrated $ UNI as a collateral asset on the platform that allows $ UNI holders to access $ USDC loans while benefiting from the below described features of the Fringe Finance platform .
And there have been many amendments passed since them .
We look forward to hearing from the Community .

The interesting part is when the price of FXS increases   the vault puts a small amount of FXS liquidity above the FXS price in the pool ( liquidity that it got from buying FXS with FRAX when the price of FXS decreased ) .
I think it will be hard to get the MKR holders to agree on the vision for the CUs so maybe the CUs also have input on the ideas as well ?
"However , I believe is crucial to define some guidelines so its work does not overlap with other ."
"As a reference , although they represent only ~0.8 percent of overall Vaults ( 34 out of 4 ’ 226 in total as of january 2022 ) , they each have minted over 10M DAI , representing a total of 7.9B DAI ( ~80 percent of overall DAI Supply ) ."

This could be developed into a strategy to ensure there is sufficient liquidity in Aave enticing users to enter the recursive strategies as borrowing costs are lowered by liquidity from bb a pools .
And how do we disrupt organizational structures that are bureaucratic—by going from monolithic businesses to MetaDAOs that build their own ecosystems .

@ Hasu I applaud your ability to peruse a simple roadmap ( constitution & council of makers ) and deliver on promises outlined in your initial delegate platform .
Coordinape I haven ’ t looked for a while coordinape .
"In accordance to this , sovereign consensus would necessarily be utilized by Uniswap ’ s implementation , and the protocol would be able to combine the benefits of both a default setup with trusted nodes ( the 4/5 configuration , e.g . )"
"The other members probably should be technical enough ( to grasp risk & be part of a multisig ) , but I wouldn ’ t expect them to be “ constantly monitoring ”   so their job is more “ validating & signing ” ."

"Since the launch , bDAO has become a flourishing community with 15,000 Discord members and 4,525 token holders , catalyzing a number of promising initiatives ranging from content generation ( the Rug , Decentralized Law , State of the DAOs , and more ) , education ( Bankless Academy ) , consulting ( Bankless Consulting ) , engineering and development work ( Degen , Bounty Board ) , community NFT and merch sales , and new financial products ( BED and GMI with IndexCoop ) ."
Also the roadmap clearly aligns with what is needed from the ux development side .
"Security procedures can be considered finished too , with the different reports to be published during the week ."
"For MakerDAO , more technical decentralization practically means “ who can enable users access to DAI after depositing collateral ? ” Or , “ how can we incentivize as many access points to DAI generation as possible ? ” Currently , there are such frontends , however incentivizing more could lead to more resilient technical decentralization ."
Information technology has been as much of an enabling factor for democratic trends as it has been an enabling factor for government authoritarianism .

Such a price level is usually unsustainable if other venues have enough liquidity and arbitrageurs can profit from converging prices .
This would bring in more revenue for the protocol in the medium term .
Interacting with the protocol is expensive on mainnet and can crowd out users who do not have the scale of capital to justify the gas expenses .
There is a ton of opportunity in the coming months on OP for FRAX to become a more dominant stablecoin at this time .

"It seems to me a great way to incentivize the use of DAI and GUSD , as well as not breaking with the basic principle of decentralization by giving the assets to a third party ."
"If enough users withdraw their ETH to the lead up to the merge , the borrow cap might no longer be effective to prevent 100 percent utilization ; if this happened the rate changes ( which can not be triggered in short time period due to governance voting and timelock delays ) would help incentivize users to deposit ETH and help ease the liquidity crisis ."
Recently Fringe Finance has integrated $ UNI as a collateral asset on the platform that allows $ UNI holders to access $ USDC loans while benefiting from the below described features of the Fringe Finance platform .
Otherwise this attack vector of “ loop holes ” /bugs may become a bit scary for Maker to expose itself to .

Very much agree with this and have been trying to beat this drum for awhile now ( [ Working Proposal ] Innovating on Fee Structures ) Think this is a good first step but would think that as we enter different yield environment ( both in terms of lending/borrowing but also perhaps with the slow death of liquidity mining ) we should think about reducing fee structures based on competitive dynamics and yield bands .

There are some challenges MakerDAO is facing that I don ’ t think are addressed with this solution alone sadly .
That is a very asymmetric equation .
People are either trying to play games and/or censor feedback .
This is great and thanks to everyone involved in this .
I think people are starved for summaries like this .
"Given that DAI ’ s most valuable characteristic is its decentralization , we believe that putting MakerDAO on a long term path to legal , technical , and economic decentralization through the workforce ( legal ) , the customer ( technical ) , and the product ( economic ) will provide a strategic direction that can help frame other operational decisions by the community ."

"and as a consequence often fight for air time rather than impact The information gap is real between outsiders ( community members ) and insiders ( CU members ) making the conversation unproductive Existence of conflicting and entangled interests is real Many things to like : Approach to projectify CU activities is extremely powerful , providing a direct link between value spent ( budget ) and value delivered ; this might make more difficult the retention of talent in DeFi , but I guess that well intended and smart contributors shouldn ’ t be worried of pitching their project one at the time , a bit like management consulting Idea of defining a budget ex ante for activities , with money that can be spent on project , is compelling This makes it easier for groups belonging to different CUs to collaborate on a specific activity , avoiding problems of task forces or unofficial groups Rank vote works very well when you have to pick which non essential projects to work on Many things still open : How to define what is core ( operations budget ) vs. what is non core will be a heavy fight , splitting open many CUs with large budgets   this won ’ t be easy to implement and will require large and essential MKR backing Linked to previous point : not easy to projectify every activity , hence we should avoid that the essential operations keep growing becoming pretty much a replica of the current CU set up The construct above doesn ’ t solve for the need to improve quality and stability of the delegation program   the most recent @ GovAlpha Core Unit proposals go in this direction but do not solve for all delegation flaws in full ( but the is material for another thread ) It is clear that complexity and costs are going out of control at MakerDAO , with little value driven and an organisation that is becoming a bureaucracy folded onto itself ."

Summary This ALM framework proposes to optimize the MakerDAO balance sheet for MKR token holders profitability while being subject to a set risk constraints MKR profitability is a slightly modified return on equity formula Two groups of constraints are : solvency and liquidity Solvency risks aim to ensure the backing of DAI Asset risk is the fluctuation of asset prices Market risk is linked to liquidation issues of crypto loans Interest rate risk is related to fixed term lending Counterparty risk is the failure of a counterparty on its expectations Credit risk is the inability to repay a loan from a borrower Liquidity risks aim to ensure the peg of DAI Maturity risk control the mismatch of maturities on the asset and liability side Shiftability risk is the failure to get liquidity that was expected from an asset The first draft of an ALM dashboard is proposed Introduction We define Asset Liability Management ( ALM ) as the tools and processes for optimizing the balance sheet to maximize token holders ’ profits while being constrained by a defined risk appetite divided as solvency and liquidity .

Grant Details Three deliverables are defined within the scope of this grant .
Aave has moved really fast in the past and should keep doing the same in the future .
This sounds like an elaborate proposal to fund raave parties .
Potential incentivization of FRAX LP .
"I am specially excited about the potential of L2 bridges driving retail user demand , one thing we know of this segment of clients is that they are cost conscious , wanting exposure to a USD peg at zero low cost ."

250M recently voted in is fine for now in my opinion but we shouldn ’ t be burning MKR again anytime soon .
"agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet , but it can be bridged on many different chains , like on Polygon with the PoS bridge ."
Splitting up is fine in general though if thats how the proposer feels would get the most changes through .
Intersections with the off chain world through financing more traditional economic activity come with their own challenges .
The broker dealer has irrevocable instructions from the Trust Sponsor to only exchange Dai for USD and vice versa based on pre agreed upon terms and may only send that Dai or USD to the Trust Sponsor ’ s escrow account with the Trustee ’ s bank or to the secure conduit .
You ’ re correct .
It might be that the amount of liquidations at Maker and DeFi as a whole was so overwhelming at the time that the keepers needed more time to arbitrage between them .
We ’ ll try to share a draft here in the coming days .

Q8 .
The importance of events and sponsorships will increase with the upcoming launch of GHO .
"MKR is a thin market and to the extent the DAO is selling into it , we would be better placed to have several desks supporting liquidity on strategic dexes and potentially with strategic buyers ."
DAI is a destination .

"The rate at which the ecosystem innovates , coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems , both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer , is also directly affected by developer productivity ."
would it be internally fixed to $ 1 ( as is the case with most other CDP stablecoins such as MakerDAO ’ s DAI ) or using a market price ?
"Finally , monitoring requirements have been proposed for community feedback before development begins on the Security Monitoring Dashboard ."
Hi tomuky Seems you still havent provided any of the details of the Asset Listing Governance Guide shared above .

"The $ PLTS token launched on December 27th , and as of today , Hermes holds around $ 2.3M in total value locked , distributed across 8 native harmony tokens in our pools and farms ."
Those 3 positions ( mainly the riskier in terms of HF ) are clearly platforms plugin into Aave .
To be clear   we are viewing this as a partnership and full time AAVE contributor role .
These are then consolidated and referenced to drive discussions and ensure that there is a holistic analysis .
"Aave on Harmony , same as on other networks , uses Chainlink as the main source of oracle prices ."
"Additionally , you may argue that the high interest rate on V2 will attract more ETH supply on V2 , but again , the elasticity is difficult to predict ."
Our commitment to the Harmony blockchain runs deep .
The FRAX FXS LP stakers already do not vote on gauges anyway so it is only a snapshot voting power they possess .
Thanks Paul and Gauntlet team for these analyses .
They are 2 separate decisions .
"Generally speaking , the features of the network are similar to that of Ethereum ."
"Also , there ’ s the standard issue of inhibiting users from withdrawing their ETH from the pool ."
"Growth has already been supporting brand initiatives with some of our key providers and has started developing branding initiatives for the protocol , but it ’ s not part of its primary objective ."
That is the purpose sir !
Success stories among stablecoin solve also the demand side of the equation .
"twitter.com Aave @ AaveAave 1/ Calling all GHOsts 👻 We have created an ARC for a new decentralized , collateral backed stablecoin , native to the Aave ecosystem , known as GHO ."
It is important to us to be closely in touch with the Uniswap community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment .
I don ’ t see the downside in UniSwap granting a license to use V3 on Harmony ONE .
( Grant a 20k FXS compensation for the development of the model and an advisory role to Liscivia to oversee its development and success . )
2 ) Tokenholder consent .
"For my own part , I plan to pursue academic research around DAO governance in general , but am also excited to talk with people about Maker specifically and to explore if there are constructive ways for me to help build new forms of governance ."

"Can anyone provide a bit of background as to how this proposal fits into any overarching budget , strategy , grants program or processes that currently exists at Compound ?"
This has presented many challenges ; the grants program is paused indefinitely due to staffing issues ; governance is disorganized ; execution of brilliant ideas and needed changes takes time ; and more .
These sub optimal interest rate models can make it tricky to maintain various markets in a way that ’ s equally favorable for both suppliers and borrowers while maintaining enough liquidity for new borrowers to enter the markets .
I remember when you took over from Rich back in the day .
This allows emissions to remain unbalanced between the Seniorage process and Fraxlend .
"As we embark on product development with Aave , we anticipate managing simulation creation , feedback integration , and reporting until the platform is ready for community control ."
"If the risk is minimized by disabling collateral ( like it is already on LUSD ) , then switching the other concerned assets to borrowing only might be preferable ."
We must not let the reservoir dwindle while we come up with new decentralized distribution plans .
"This would mitigate the risk vector , yet cause minimal disruption to the existing markets ."
I ’ ll leave that to someone who knows what they ’ re talking about .
Hi Aave Community Llama has been an active contributor to the Aave ecosystem and we would like to present ourselves to the community as a trusted delegate .
We look forward to any additional comments from the Uniswap Community .
"In fact , our tool sometimes finds bugs after audits , and even after the code is deployed ."
"I ’ d argue , however , that reducing the reserve factors by 0.025 , especially for DAI , would be insufficient to bring Compound significantly closer to the Market Rate or to significantly impact its market share ."
"Although Maker is capable of providing credit to these protocols / CEXes , their missions may not align with the DAO ."
Pools .
"It ’ s just a reciept for actual btc which you might or might be not able to redeem at a time of need , so it actually bears quite a bit of more risks than btc itself ."
Also since Polygon market generates about 3M in weekly revenue for the DAO   it would be a good step to start the conversation for Polygon market too .
To keep it clean i ’ ll move actual suggestions to separate post .
"On Twitter Let ’ s play a game , with Uniswap Labs and @ Wordcelllabs ."
"To facilitate communication with the sole director and/or supervisor of RWA Foundation , as may be required from time to time , Maker token holders , in approval of the proposed transaction , will authorize certain individuals to act as a “ Delegated Committee ” ."
🥳 Still have questions about the vault ?
I agree with your concern about discrepancies and it will definitely be noted for the future .
"At the same time we could deploy MCD slave instances on Polygon and Avanalche , both with 250M and make use of whatever collateral is available there ."

What you ’ re referring to is a minimum required yield .
Great proposals by both @ Llamaxyz and @ AaveCompanies !
The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO ’ s treasury .
"Speaking of seeing RWA loans managed more efficiently , will the HVB Stability Fees be paid monthly , quarterly , semi annual , annual ?"
"Also , as far as I can tell , mDAOs would have a debt ceiling ( 250M for RWA mDAOs ) which is reviewed quarterly based on the framework criteria , so they need to operate during that time with limited deployment of capital up to their debt ceiling ."
This timeframe can be at the discretion of the team .
"To execute this mission , Celo ’ s technology features include : A mobile first EVM compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone Carbon negative by allocating 0.1 percent of epoch rewards to offset carbon—to date , 2,942 tons of carbon has been offset , which is over 8 times Celo ’ s carbon footprint Algorithmic Celo stablecoins ( currently cUSD , cEUR , and cREAL ) with a smart contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the Celo reserve , currently made up of CELO , the network ’ s native asset , as well as BTC , ETH , DAI , and MCO2 Celo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.6M addresses , up to 1.1M daily transactions , and over 103M transactions ."
"Of note , the largest DPI supplier by a wide margin is currently using it ( and aWETH ) as collateral to borrow a significant amount of USDT ."
This strategy is subject to Aave ’ s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve ’ s governance process .
All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds .
"In protocols such as Maker , we have seen many teams employ RWAs , but the community lacks awareness of these loans ’ performance , efficacy , and status after being funded ."
I value Llama ’ s contribution to DeFi but I don ’ t think this proposal is makes sense in the current form .

"As you know , although I am not currently part of any core unit , I am operating under SES ’ s incubation program as part of a future Lending Compliance CU , for this reason I would be very happy to be involved , as humble servant of the DAO ."
Another fun idea is to put a Deco floating to fixed layer on top each backstop buffer .
There are 3 sources of yield for FRAX single sided depositors on Anzen in exchange for providing default protection for private credit notes : Exogenous Yield that comes outside of Defi : monthly premiums coming from tradfi .

"If this pace of growth continues , we expect to surpass 2,500 daily users within the next month ."
"Utilizing arUSD , users can swap between a variety of synthetic cryptocurrencies and LP tokens and farm on synthetic yield farms that track the APR of their native chain counterparts ."
It ’ s outdated because it has nothing to do with the app or frax at all neither of those things have betting in them .
"Cleanly separate the what ( vision , goals ) from how ( strategy ) , so they can be discussed and decided individually ."
This seems counterproductive .
"We propose a transparent measurement of this project ’ s success through the following success criteria and long term goals : percent of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets : 40 percent of the Celo Reserve ( at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $ 200M USD in green assets ) $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets : 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve : 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere ( assuming an average price of $ 12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels ) , including all associated benefits ( e.g ."
It is clear you have used your experience in Maker and modeled it to Aave .

Ideally we should think of implementing an upgrade to Liq 2.0 where auction ’ s throughput rate limiting works with a decay .
"Ceazor : perhaps getting them listed as collateral in more places Today ibXXX isn ’ t accepted as collateral in ANY markets , partly because of the way risk is managed in relation to the listings on Iron Bank and the relationship with Fixed Forex as the minter ."
Hi all !
Making sure the FraxBP is well funded is a higher priority than increasing treasury assets .
"Are they going to decrease the risk parameters , increase marketing , expect higher demand due to maker conditions , tap into new markets , etc ?"
Profits would then be returned to token holders using the buyback and burn model .
– Liquidity providers often expressed the idea that the opportunity cost of participating in governance is too high compared to their regular operations .
"In doing so , RWAC has a good understanding of all governance requirements and of all the internal mechanisms of oversight and monitoring of the DAO ."
"Check the CIP for language ( spelling , grammar , sentence structure , etc ."
"It ’ s also important that the community has the chance to hear these proposals and engage with the providers openly , rather than have the process intermediated behind closed doors ."
"Applications that build on top of Uniswap can help the ecosystem become more decentralized , drive more liquidity to the platform , and get more people involved in governance ."
Anonymized contributions afterwards .

Does it refer to how concentrated Robinland ’ s underlying portfolio is ?
Should “ abstain ” votes be counted towards quorum ?
"As of today , we have identified three key levers that can ignite this Second Growth Engine : institutional vaults , real world assets , and multi chain expansion ."
Why don ’ t you open a bank ?

"They focus on assisting clients with the identification of potential credit issues through loan portfolio credit review and portfolio stress testing ( http : //www.crfadvisors.com/loan review/ ) In addition to these , the Bank is a publicly held company and subject to all required SEC reviews and reporting , including 10Qs , 10Ks , etc. , all of which are available at EDGAR Entity Landing Page These are The Governance Documents of The Bank : Bylaws of HV Bancorp , Inc ."
"Perhaps it is time to discuss the Maker Mission and come up with a mission statement and use this to guide efforts , funding , and measuring tangible results ."
One possible future is where the voting process itself can be distributed among different chains .
"There could be KPIs for each ticket item , then bonuses could be calculated as KPI * value score == [ 0 , 1 ] * value score ."
This will be a cost for Maker .
C2tP C2tP : Also the current setup calls for staking left over cvxCrv im assuming the treasury FXS will only be used for bribes once the cvxCRV has been exhausted .
The strategy has generated approximately 20.5 percent fee ( annualized ) so far .
Would not mind to increase the LT to 85 percent as it would bring wider breathing space to avoid liquidations together by decreasing the max LTV for new positions to avoid creating additional risk in case the appetite to borrow ETH against stETH comes back mid term ( and would help later to decrease it when the effective arbitrage is in place ) .

"Regarding your question about the allocation of funds , some aspects : Even with the co founders of BGD Labs being personally community members of Aave , BGD Labs will act as a service provider to the Aave DAO with this proposal ."
"If so , why would this not be part of that process ?"
"This is critical as an equal amount of TVL in these pools helps with the maintenance of peg , whereas ibXXX+USDC doesn ’ t and chainlink oracles can easily be used as this reference point ."
"By using the protocol price feed , a discounted price of the seized collateral is determined , and it is sold publicly ."
"Well , this is juicy   lots of new accounts created in the past day , and eyes are on the forum because of this discourse ."
"We have coordinated with @ AaveCompanies for the testing/QA on the Aave IPFS interface , being successful at the moment ."
"Really you should just pick good borrowers , and good protocols and let individuals buy insurance if they want , rather than force this cost on everyone ( most of whom will not participate in this pool ) ."
"As of now , we are also tentatively planning to host a Crowdcast livestream to review the contents of the report with someone from the Uniswap Grants Program and myself ."
"Cuz if people are going to be exposed to a “ stablecoin ” that doesn ’ t follow any certain value , don ’ t you think DAI just will lose all its impact ?"
"MarcZeller : As pointed out by @ stani and according to historical market data , stablecoin usage in DeFi is mainly used as borrowed currency and we witness little to no usage as a collateral asset ( I guess no one wants to use the future of France to short the future of France ? )"
"With this in mind , we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to the Gnosis Chain ."
"This proposal passed with nearly 100 percent voting “ For , ” and was executed on November 30 ."
A great way of diversifying treasuries and decreasing exposure and risk in Aave ’ s treasury .
"In that , I mean limiting the speed at which certain assets can be deposited or borrowed ."
Why is vendor lock in problematic ?
"Properly developing relationships with borrowers of scale takes time , legal frameworks will take time , underwriting real world collateral and being a competitive source of funding will take time , etc , etc ."
Its biggest advantage is being first mover and having a large moat with other projects having already integrated with it .
"Like I said , I think this makes sense specifically for the Frax Temple pool especially since Temple is already willing to buy it from the stakers ."
Provide more info on how GFX will work with the community to ensure they are building the right solutions for the protocol .
Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2 .
"This is a really important part of the ecosystem , which will probably grow in the future as more platforms integrate the Aave governance ."
But the past few days have illustrated the need to reach a consensus decisively   and with vigor .
"Wormhole stresses its large team , its internal penetration testing unit , and its security credentials in ."
"Upon the occurrence of an event of default by HVB that is not cured within thirty ( 30 ) days of notices of the event of default , the Trust may , at its sole option and discretion , and upon written notice to HVB , any one or more of the following : a ) Suspend the Servicing Fee provided to HVB and/or commence to renegotiate with HVB the terms and conditions of the servicing ."
"As this will be our largest RWA exposure to date , I trust he ’ ll put forth the gold standard for MKR token holders ."
"I think his concern goes back to implementation of the AMO and ironing out the specific parameters for deployment/retraction of capital   details of which will be managed by the Frax and Centrifuge devs post proposal , perhaps a line in the proposal something like “ In deployment of the AMO the Frax and Centrifuge developers will implement controls in redemption and deployment to manage risk of capital availability for the FRAX peg ” ."
Those that have 10k for example and look at rates and just throw it into the Boost because the APY is higher .
Is there a way to make the gauge work more targeted instead of sponsoring the whole pool ?
"During May and June ’ s difficult crypto ecosystem events , liquidations functioned well across V3 markets , minimizing insolvencies while market size was reduced by two thirds ."
"If so , are there any recall mechanisms ?"
"What additional factors impact Minting & Reserve revenues ibXXX assets ’ main use case today remains borrowing for the purpose of farming , which requires the incentivization of curve pools ."
DAI has the most integrations of any decentralised stablecoin across DeFi ( and the total supply has 7xed or something in 12 months ) .
Adding a supply cap mitigates the protocol ’ s concern of an infinite mint attack and empowers the protocol to onboard assets it might not otherwise support .
I think the same discussion for rETH will be had around listing assets with zero LTV ratio .
"Upon discussing the asset listing with the Lido community , we learned there are likely to be new decentralised exchange liquidity pools emerging in the near future ."
Based on past performance it would be higher .
The current process has been enshrined in several third party apps like Boardroom .
"An example would be Tally plus contributors ’ data showing information on who has voted , how active they are in the communities discord and forum etc ."
It is strongly recommended that the reader first familiarize themselves with the concepts of YIP 65 in order to better understand this proposal .
We unfortunately managed to create the mainstream image of the crypto bro as the one type of person that ’ s even worse than the wall street banker bro .
@ Philinje I will remember you !
"Aave Protocol is lucky to have BGD , it is a rare sign of true decentralization !"
Encode in writing what we can ’ t encode in smart contract code .
If you could please expand on the market segment focus and product positioning of both Maker & DAI .
"Ideas like Clean Money and Financial Inclusion stemmed from this perspective , that if we played our cards right and used the last big crypto bull run to show real tangible benefits beyond what people would be expecting that truly showcase the massive positive potential of blockchain to the mainstream , such as mass financing of large scale renewable energy infrastructure that effectively did the governments job for it , or large scale access to cheap and efficient financial services for developing countries , etc ."
Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied ?
At some point governance is going to need some clear declaration of intended process as well as who is responsible to carry out the pieces of process .
"The extra USDC revenues aren ’ t sufficient to cover the performance fee , so we would need to tap into prior years ’ accrued reserves and/or swap other stablecoin reserves for USDC just to pay the bonus ."
Do we have a breakdown of how many hours were worked and how much was paid for this work ?
"Nevertheless , some authorities , and especially the SEC , might decide to exert their jurisdiction over the products , despite the fact that these products are not marketed or offered to US persons ."
"Proving himself consistently both compassionate and ethical , my interactions with @ Patrick_J frequently remind me how much more there is to give for me as a facilitator ."
We won ’ t liquidate or try to migrate as soon as APY drops .
Audits & Security List of relevant security audits of the network Security has always been our main priority .
"As such , HVBank shares equally in losses while MakerDAO benefits from HVBank ’ s incentive to maximize yield ."
"As a simple example , we had to put a lot of time into building support for EIP1559 , just like every other core Ethereum team did ."
"If there is an on chain action to be executed , the forum post should be accompanied by an on chain vote ."
Will this be through community votes or an internal committee ?
Thank you .

"China is giving the world a preview of CBDC ; this is good in a way , because it shows the rest of the world the predictable outcome of directly state controlled money ( statist surveillance dystopia ) Recent Canada trucker incident of debanking political opponents / protesters was a big wake up call , particularly because Trudeau had been viewed as a very liberal figure ; this episode undermined the argument that government financial control is only problematic in authoritarian states , not democracies CBDC are unlikely to be adopted/mandated in the US and other pro market states regardless , because it conflicts with vested interests in the financial sector and would remove free market forces from credit creation US govt needs new sources of reserve demand , and global retail usage of USD instruments ( stablecoins ) is by far the most viable option with the least negative impact to the domestic economy ( compare with requiring banks to hold greater amount of treasuries or central bank reserves , which would starve the private sector of credit ) The economic benefits of faster/real time electronic payments are huge , but they can only be really achieved using instruments with settlement assurance ( otherwise the payments are not real time , because the recipient needs to wait to avoid chargebacks , exactly like current T+2 systems ) Real time payments can not be safely implemented with centralized assets ; consider what would happen if Circle had their admin keys compromised and used to mint unlimited USDC without authorization ; only decentralized assets can provide provable security So what exactly should we be doing ?"
"LongForWisdom : i ’ d like to continue to contribute to MakerDAO , potentially in other positions or on discrete initiatives that don ’ t involve committing to ongoing responsibilities ."
but i see no reason why this cant be changed and just use FRAX and not bother with arUSD in the first place .
The Frax team is already growing and working on a huge scope .
"For instance , Nirun mentioned that proposals are not always fully explained to users , making them complex and difficult to understand ."
Our team is bullish that Thetanuts with its new product can scale with Frax to provide Frax holders with a high base yield and be a champion for the ecosystem as Anchor has been for Terra/Luna .

Can ’ t wait to see this in action !
Awesome thanks a lot for the detailed feedback .
We have run this by community members and stakeholders and they ’ ve been supportive .
Building FRAX liquidity in Aurora and NEAR as an extension seems like a no brainer to me !
"Gauntlet has limited market risk concerns with Monet ’ s borrower cap increase , but we want to note that around 90 percent of the borrowing is being driven by this one account ."
"I think it could be an interesting way to experiment with the fee switch for the following reasons : Safer oracles would benefit the whole DeFi space ; Over time this initiative could lead to Uniswap TWAP oracles becoming the gold standard in DeFi ; All of the fees would still go to LPs , therefore potentially limiting the loss of pre existing LPs as the fee switch is enabled ; The fees would compensate longer focussed LPs over Just In Time liquidity providers ; This initiative would be quite easy to roll back if it fails vs paying $ UNI holders a dividend ."
But I think Kris makes some good points .
It all feels a bit incestuous and that there are potential issues for “ control ” of the DAO .
"First things first , I support this proposal and believe Aave Companies should be rewarded for their contribution into building Aave v3 ."
The Alpha phase will be two months from around the start of November .
Two months ago SifDAO made a proposal to Frax to bring FRAX liquidity to Sifchain .
We believe the retroactive funding model used here is fair for the DAO because it enables us ( as a contributor ) to be accurate with our incurred costs while providing the community with the opportunity to assess the product ’ s value and thus support these types of proposals with confidence .

HVB attains flexibility and savviness by plugging into DeFi via MakerDAO .
We have no intention of liquidating the LP tokens .
So with that in mind FRAX will need to assess what amount they could afford to put at risk in this AMO and still hold the peg in the event of a bank run .

all USDC payments ) would be directed to vKP3R holders as revenue paid out bi weekly alongside all other fees This is a key benefit for token holders that chose to invest & a unique selling point of the Keep3r protocols since it effectively compensates vested token holders against dilution of their position by monetizing the new token creation process and providing fees directly to vKP3R as well as allowing each vKP3R holder to increase their overall holding at a discounted rate   ensuring that they have an opportunity to maintain a similar level of claim on protocol fees .

"On the proposals of deployments on networks where Aave v2 already existed ( Polygon , Avalanche ) , a topic that appeared was if the route should be to upgrade the smart contracts of v2 to v3 ( given that it was theoretically possible to do it by modifying the v3 implementation ) or to simply do a “ clean ” new deployment of Aave v3 , and let v2 and v3 live together on those networks ."

This should increase FRAX liquidity and protocol earnings when demand is low for RWA lending The Default insurance fund The Default insurance fund is a fund that can be used to insure the investors against the risks of a RWA lending protocol defaulting on payments .
They have different programs in place to compensate newcomers in a more dependable way .

We firmly believe that using such community standards is the most solid way to maintain the security of the codebase and the security of the entire system .
"Alternatively , prioritizing resiliency insinuates a move to the originally intended “ soft peg ” for DAI by removing , or at least limiting , the amount of centralized stablecoins held on MakerDAO ’ s balance sheet through the PSM ."

"At any time , Liquidity Providers can withdraw by redeeming their FIDU for USDC at an exchange rate based on the net asset value of the Senior Pool , minus a 0.5 percent withdrawal fee ."
So why would one invest in a token where you get only downside risk and seemingly ineffective voting power ?
We just make wrapped USDC ?
I ’ m curious as to what this means .
"With fixedforex soon to launch on fantom network , and thekeep3r network due to go live on more chains imminently , more new users and investors are likely to come onboard , therefore now would be a good time to widen up the resource pool in support of the dev and leadership teams ."
My reasons for thinking a budget is needed is pretty simple .
"There was a last minute change to the cbETH price oracle , which is going to be posted against ETH instead of USD from here on out , so we have some price feed wrapper contracts to handle that , which ought still be audited by OpenZeppelin before deploying and launching this market ."
Having Compound ’ s UAV Oracle mimic this shift provides higher reliability and more security by reducing the risk of price manipulation or any other issues related to low liquidity .
The spirit behind this proposal was to make this an easy decision for Aave token holders to onboard new DAO contributors as we move forward to further decentralizing protocol risk management and scale Aave as a whole .
With the “ MetaDAO ” portion there seems to be division on the extent to which Maker should support these associated businesses and capital buffers .

"Burning tokens does not reward all token holders equally ; larger holders get higher benefit , because they can ’ t easily exit their position without large slippage , while smaller holders can exit much faster and cheaper ."
I couldnt find anything about it in the documentation but Im happy to hear that the bridge already exists .
"this is a fair point but if Maker can not build a consensus vision and strategy , there is a growing risk that Maker becomes economically irrelevant as other players better innovate and adapt to the dynamic evolving crypto market ."
"It is my own opinion , crude risk analysis is straight forward , better documentation from Aave companies would enable this and the cost of basis risk analysis can somewhat be socialised with rewards for impact ."

This is well thought out .
I don ’ t think the amount we ’ re raising in isolation could accurately be described as being too much or too little without knowing what the team is planning to do with the capital .
We will post this code when it is ready for additional review by the community Disclosures The authors of this post hold no UNI tokens nor have any price exposure to UNI via alternative methods ( i.e .
"Community Guardian renewal We voted YES : The community guardian will as stated , be temporary and allow V3 markets to be upgraded to the cross chain governance module ."
We believe that some minor tweaks to the first two stages will produce higher signal value while reducing some of the existing operational overhead and complexity .
This presents several problems .
Bruuuuuuuh the entire community has been anti bank from the get—where have you been ?
As always it will cover the grants that were awarded during that time and highlight other key metrics .

Treasury Vision 2   Have to say this is a great document but how well have they executed on it ?
"Otherwise , this is a lot of complexity for an effectively unsecured loan ."
These loans are typically floating rate but convert to a fixed rate if held through conversion .
So now a gauge for fsMLP will not be very efficient in increasing FRAX usage .
This is where we believe we should focus .
Why is it advisable to safeguard against adverse events through an expanded System Surplus rather than through the MKR minting process ?

Thanks Mike this is very detailed proposal and I am very supportive   I ’ m a big fan of Centrifuge !
Long Answer : We are not looking at changing how MKR holders vote ( yet ) and want to focus on correcting how budgets are allocated ( assigning capital to work instead of the workforce as it is today ) .

Beautiful graphs .
"In the meanwhile , we encourage the community to continue asking questions to the team on the details that are unclear or require further colour ."
For cross chain governance safety is crucial ; on the other hand liveness issues can be tolerated to an extent ( i.e .
"If so , what is the process and what stakeholders are involved ?"

"This isn ’ t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives , or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens   this is just the reality of the current context ."
This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross chain governance module .
"While I don ’ t think committing to specific KPI is necessary , as @ klinko suggested , as measuring research and engineering output can be difficult , having a set of goals outlined will help the Uniswap DAO assess whether this grant was well spent later , and make further funding down the line easier as there will be a track record of execution ."
The argument for growth is understandable but it does represent a large shift in what was originally presented .
if we assume that in 5 years time we have $ 1b loaned out that would mean there has been $ 1b more in sell pressure then there has been in buy pressure .

We look forward to hearing everyone ’ s thoughts on this unique proposal .
We look forward to productive debate around how a constellation of token holders can efficiently and responsibly govern real world conduits that hold a diverse set of assets .
My takeaway from the broad scope of @ GFXlabs ’ s proposal that this should be viewed less as a decision on “ tasks to be done ” & how we measure the value of these tasks to the protocol   and more as a decision on “ people to be hired ” for the general benefit of Compound .

"We initiated the Temperature Check on Snapshot , where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community ."
"Furthermore , we have received a significant amount of requests from our community , but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform ."
We ’ ll see more realistic borrowing activities after this change .
The distribution of liquidity is what concerns us .
Borrowers : Solvency of collateral assets supplied to other markets Low borrow cost Predictable borrow cost Suppliers : Solvency of supplied asset Continuous availability of withdrawal liquidity High supply yield Predictable supply yield Protocol : Solvency of all asset markets and protocol overall Good user experience for both borrowers and suppliers High market share of borrowing and deposits Reserve growth and protocol revenue We can draw some inferences on ideal parameters by comparing the stakeholder preferences above .
"For example , they can vote to onboard collateral which would maximize their own portfolio rather than that of Maker as a whole ."
"Contract Related Information Deployment of the LUSD contract   05 April 2021 : Ethereum Transaction Hash ( Txhash ) Details | Etherscan The first minting of LUSD   05 April 2021 : Ethereum Transaction Hash ( Txhash ) Details | Etherscan Number of transactions on LUSD : 197,461 ( + ~2000 on Optimism ) Number of token holders on LUSD : 4758 ( + ~100 on Optimism ) Risk Assessment We followed Aave ’ s risk assessment methodology to provide all the necessary metrics : I ’ m not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the “ Permission ” category , so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard , LUSD is almost as safe as ETH ."
The following initialization proposal creates supply caps for five collateral assets and seeds the market with initial reserves .
"That is correct , would you please break these to separate proposals , otherwise for/against voting is misleading ."

YFI is time locked up to 4 years where a longer lock increases the relative weight in relation to other locked tokens .
"As of December 31 , 2021 , the Bank reported assets at fiscal year end of $ 557.79 million , employed about 140 people across a variety of specializations and departments , and operated nearly a dozen offices in 3 states ( PA , DE , and NJ ) with a geographic operating area running from New York to North Carolina and as far west as Ohio and West Virginia ."
This means we can turn the fees for a limited set of pools .

"Introduction To support the continued growth of Aave , new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market ."
This vote will determine if Balancer DAO proceeds with the tokenswap as outline above .
I encourage Gauntlet to work on a re run and will be supportive of an updated proposal .
There has never been a serious hack or fault in the protocol ’ s architecture .
of a smart contract upgrade ?
"We have written rules for that purpose , successfully showing that no code paths can trigger the exploit ."
I think the centralized voting power is a big one that needs to be resolved at some point ( maybe some way to convince exchanges to make a way to delegate ) .
"Subject to any future agreement by the DAO to the contrary , the Foundation will hold the DAO and its members harmless with respect to any liabilities or damages assessed against the Foundation or its personnel based upon the making of the disbursement , the Foundation ’ s or its personnel ’ s use of the disbursed tokens or any other activities undertaken by the Foundation or its personnel in furtherance of the foregoing , other than liabilities or damages arising out of the DAO ’ s fraud , willful misconduct or criminal activity ."

Are there any restrictions for MakerDAO to reuse this construct with other banks ?
"The collateral is not owned by the protocol , so the protocol can not touch it to avoid unpegging ."
"Summary Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of a native decentralized , collateral backed stablecoin , GHO , pegged to USD ."
Does this issue also affect rKP3R rewards being provided to curve pools ?
"There are a number of reasons why I chose 28 day intervals : Provides more gradual reductions Normalization will occur with each proposal , increasing the efficacy of rewards as markets change New markets will receive rewards without too much of a delay it ’ s tempting to wonder whether the decay schedule could be implemented by a change to the comptroller that uses epochs It ’ s a great thing to consider down the line ."
"BGD will tackle the task , and uncertainties apart ( community not approving , model not really defined , etc ) , will compromise to complete it ."
What you ’ re describing as a “ poor yield ” is actually the “ market rate ” and you wouldn ’ t be able to buy the loan for less anywhere else .
Currently the 10 percent performance fee acts as a form of marketing tool to draw attention and attract new talent to write strategies for Yearn vaults .
The system rejects a Chainlink update that deviates too far from the Uniswap TWAP .
We are now absolutely convinced that the protocols & vested token holders would be major beneficiaries should dedicated & compensated roles be implemented & incorporated as part of the Keep3r team .

The project is co founded by Sergey Gorbunov and Georgios Vlachos who have an impressive academic background in cryptography and were founding team members at Algorand .
I truly believe there are very intelligent and passionate people working for this protocol and I don ’ t think anyone is trying to actively sabotage it .
Share the work plan with the community .
40 percent OCR = you need 140 $ of collateral to open a CDP and borrow 100 $ of FRAX UCR 40 $ = OCR 40 $ These examples allow us to understand how the introduction of Dynamic Collateral Requirements ( DCR ) in needed to provide the protocol with the necessary flexibility to withstand demand fluctuations between the Seniorage and the Lending minting process .

"In my opinion it is better to incentivize keepers to bond more kp3r , not reduce the amount ."
unfortunately this proposal didn ’ t meet quorum but as it was non contentious we ’ re supportive of a re run .
GHO is important to support as it offers large potential for Aave DAO in terms of revenue generation and becoming a flagship product in the ecosystem .
"Let me share some of the research pieces we drafted up on perpetual swaps + UNI v3 : 0xCrema and I wrote a deep dive thread into GMX ( arbitrum ’ s largest protocol ) and opensourced our findings here We also built a backtesting framework for our UNI v3 LP vault strategies , which we also opensourced We have also written research threads on other perp protocols such as Perp + Drift ."
However I ’ m not saying that ’ s an end all solution just one of them and it proves there is no risk that you keep insisting there is .
Bug bounty .
The BLB tokens will be on a vesting schedule of a 1 year cliff and 3 years vesting thereafter–the same vesting schedule as protocol contributors and investors .
Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity .

"Market listing , research , and management We will continue to list new markets with continual and agile improvement of related processes and requirements , including updated deployment scripts and/or tools ."
"In doing so , users more comfortable with the existng protocol can continue using it , and the existing protocol will continue to serve the use cases of borrowing other assets , such as : Staking borrowed assets Users who have stakeable assets but whom are unwilling to take on the risks and responsibilities of managing such stakes can lend out these assets to others who specialize in managing stakes Quick liquidity for OTC desks OTC desks can borrow assets to perform quick trades for their customers and can then subsequently slowly buy back the token to repay their debts while avoiding slippage Strategic governance Some users may be contributing to multiple projects simultaneously while not having the capital to hold meaningful amounts of tokens to participate in the governance of each and every project , so instead , they can strategically borrow against their bags to have more of a say Shorting tokens With that being said , Compound Protocol will continue to be developed to maximize the number of borrowable assets in a safe and capital efficient manner ."
This proposal can create a win win for both parties .
Quick look at the history MakerDAO has been burning MKR for years now .
"@ devinwalsh from the Uniswap Foundation restarts a conversation about adjusting the Uniswap governance process , primarily to “ reduce overhead ” and “ enhance off chain signaling. ” The main changes are : replace the first Snapshot poll ( a temp check , as below for example ) with a request for comment ( RFC ) post in the forum ( such as this very one ) ; and increase the quorum to 5M UNI for the remaining Snapshot ( the “ consensus check ” ) ."
The downside is that raising interest rates makes the market more unpredictable when the ETH pool utilization exceeds the Kink .

"still requires integration with service provider like Gauntlet , Chaos Labs , etc. , but assessing Aave users fraud score + credit score based on asset pool utilization could give Aave an ‘ early warning ’ system for these types of “ profitable strategies. ” For example , if the CRV pool ’ s borrow utilization went from 1 percent to 10 percent of higher fraud score borrowers , Aave could proactively lower LTVs or discontinue borrowing in a particular pool to mitigate bad debt risk until further investigation took place ."

New replies are no longer allowed .
"First , if ETH interest rate curve isn ’ t high enough , then this won ’ t prevent high ETH utilization on V3 ( the BPT strategy may be highly profitable , so the cost of borrowing ETH has to be very high until the strategy is no longer profitable ) , and high ETH utilization can interfere with atomic liquidations ( for user positions that are using ETH as collateral ) ."

Or maybe each vote can store the current stkMKR : MKR ratio and keep the conversion factor fixed during the vote ?
"In relation to this Khan : It ’ s possible to launch pools denominated in other assets , such as Frax , but there are much easier ways to get Frax exposure ."
"For example if someone builds a 4 percent yield strategy for Frax and amasses 100m TVL , FraxP could sponsor another 4m per year , which would result on an 8 percent APR , but most importantly , this 100m of Frax demand means that FraxP has an additional 100m of collateral which it can use to invest in uncollateralized loans strategies that yield > 6 percent per year ."

Oookay I get it now .
So if that ’ s your concern I ’ m glad it ’ s solved .
This will represent the largest RWA vault to date and 5th largest MakerDAO vault currently outstanding .
This implementation still has many tradeoffs   the most obvious one is that a large vault owner then knows his debt can not be liquidated within a day and he has even more time to react .
Maybe it ’ s world cup syndrome but it ’ s still not fun .
We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed .

This enables MakerDAO to cleanly and verifiably burn attackers ’ stake in the protocol without disruptive snapshot based migrations that risk total loss of funds held in AMM exchanges ( owners of old MKR could dump into AMM after snapshot ) or collateral damage to lending protocols ( owners of old MKR could deposit to lending protocols and borrow funds after snapshot ) .

"There is nothing stopping strategists from also contributing to Yearn in other capacities , why does that have to change ?"
"Now that we ’ ve clarified the cross chain messaging aspect and weighed in on how the current choice might affect future capabilities , before choosing a bridge provider and/or the technology behind it —which is , in our view , the most important aspect of this decision , as also delineated by Other Internet , in their thought process— we should keep in mind that Uniswap has a massive TVL , which significantly affects the economic incentives that are ingrained ( directly or indirectly ) in the bridging mechanism ."

"The longer token holders lock their tokens , the more voice credits are earned and the greater their claim to POP rewards ."
Building this project on chain enables better visibility as well as ability to scale the reserve pool with a global defi user base and have a transparent governance structure to manage this treasury and it gives all users ( large or small ) a chance to be involved in receiving these yields that normally wouldn ’ t be accessible to small depositors .

We would be excited to welcome such a partner to the Centrifuge community and very much look forward to the potential collaboration .
I think that would help align incentives more between the two protocols .
The nature of asset management for protocol DAOs such as Aave at the moment means that there will be large trades that are telegraphed well in advance ; execution and performance will suffer as the market front runs any planned rebalances .
"And this is because it is harder to liquidate multiple asset types in a secondary market , correct ?"

It is true that there are clearly valid points in Vitalik ’ s analysis on how a component of retro active funding is important for decentralized communities .
"Agree on this @ ElProgreso , The work of the RWF team ( s ) is not an easy one , as it involves several things to run in parallel : Find consensus over a vision → we started this with the Sandbox Communicate this vision internally and externally → we are doing this daily with all the counterparts involved , including Monetalis Protect Maker from existential threats while keeping an open mind to innovation → we are doing this through the DD efforts of all past and present MIPs Show the community we can deliver in the short term while we keep raising the quality bar → we hope we will soon be able to deliver , within Q1 , in line with this vision Develop all checks and balances internally to make this happen , the Methodology posted here is a very important step in that direction → SES ’ s incubation program goes in this direction , with all the relevant CUs ( risk/ legal/ compliance ) part of such program as we speak We are all excited and extremely optimistic ."

I like the question you are asking I do wonder if it is a feasible investigation .
Adding EUROC to the Compound protocol is a great idea .
I can ’ t seem to edit the earlier post but agree with you .
Thank you
This dynamic meshes nicely with existing initiatives being explored for the monetization of Maker ’ s treasury assets .
ElProgreso : but I don ’ t believe there ’ s an alignment between MKR token owners I agree .
CRV is one of the best earning revenue streams outside of stables .
A Snapshot for this proposal will be posted on December 12 .
"@ blockworks_ publishes an op ed by John Morrow of Gauntlet pointing to their new advisory standard with DAOs ( see proposal above ) : “ if you are wrong , you don ’ t get paid. ” In Discord Leighton asks “ when do we cut all COMP V2 Distribution ? ? ?"
"ANZ is backed by its protocol owned liquidity ( POL ) , and will continue to generate yield from a TradFi to Defi income stream that is paid into the protocol reserve on chain as stablecoin ( USDC initially , but one can envision this form of payment be upgraded to FRAX in the future which further increase the utility of FRAX ) ."

Governance proposals : might be a good low bar but easily exploited .
will impact a protocol in various situations .
"Bryan from Otherinternet said it best in his post on this topic in the Uniswap forum : As an initiative framed as growing/sustaining ethereum public goods , we need to view this proposal and others like it as an easy opportunity to mobilize stagnant capital , not a budgeting exercise ."
When is it too broad ?
Examples of our previous work include : State of Aave Q2 Weekly user analysis and liquidity report Subgraphs for v2 + v3 across every deployment on various chains Financial reporting is only as good as the number of people it informs and we believe this will help keep existing stakeholders informed while also bringing in additional capital through the wide distribution of these reports .
I think it should .
What Is Our Suggested Solution ?
Also its possible that from a future viewpoint we would have burned in hindsight more now with less revenue then with more revenue later because MKR price went up with Eth price after PoS and we need 10x the adoption to overcome the gap .

Just a small noob question : how do i find this proposal to vote ?
The second investment theme is more complex .
There are many possible solutions to creating a model that allows more experienced teams or teams with more history and operational success within Maker to receive a higher budget for execution .
"Please excuse the slow execution , currently on the go and don ’ t have as much time and attention to devote to it as I would like to have ."
"Should i remind everybody , that the whole idea of halving COMP distributions several month ago was to use COMP saved to Kickstart rewards ?"
Enable Sending ETH from Timelock ( Revised ) We voted FOR : Interesting quirk with the Governor that we were not aware of .
For let ’ s say long term legitimacy reasons I think it is important to resume ( throttled ) burning first and only then maybe stop burning again .
"While all these debates about the proposals are fine , imo AAVE would find more utility ( 1 ) getting the facts right on this attack ( it was not targeted at CRV liquidity/short squeeze ; it was targeted at outdated price oracles ) ; ( 2 ) paying out bug bounties to dedicated white hat systems analyzers like myself who have submitted bug bounties detailing the exact nature and path of this exploit well before it occurred , which if heeded , would ’ ve saved AAVE the $ 1.5m in bad debt it accrued , and the $ 20  $ 40m that was actually vulnerable ."
Our door will always be open to those who share our passion for DeFi & Compound .
Our upcoming release of the Audit Report and Bug Disclosure should provide helpful details to the community so that everyone can learn from what ’ s been discovered .
A Uniswap Labs Twitter Space .
There are many teams outside of Labs building on the Protocol today ( many are listed in the UGP retrospective ) however we believe there is a massive opportunity for grants to fund additional ambitious and impactful projects .
Happy to do more debates in the future if it helps us move toward a consensus .
I don ’ t really see the usefulness with giving fxs rewards to an entire pool that has such little frax .
"i have not made any criticisms , i have simply asked for information about your project and the team involved ."
"Anyway , it look like the stolen crypto will not be recovered as you agreed ."
"Especially when motivation is like : we are not sure what going to happen , so let ’ s try that ."
"In the class I teach , we ’ re spend a great deal of time focusing on individual motivations , which , in turn , drive their actions ."
"We suggest following up with another proposal after this one ( as was done for cUSDCv3 ) , to migrate remaining rewards from v2 to cWETHv3 and cUSDCv3 ."
"Therefore , we believe it is urgent to address both the growth and resilience topics , in order to protect and capitalize Maker ’ s first moving advantage , and shape the future of the protocol ."
We would like to continue working with the Aave Companies to have appropriate team members at events as well as look to expand participation to include other ecosystem members such as BGD .
What motivates people to stay involved in governance initiatives ?
Change 1 : Snapshot proposals can only be submitted by team members or someone designated by the team .
"Once again , thank you for the quick response and also apology for my short reasoning , which might have come off as a bit rude ."
The ability for proposers to deploy their proposal code to selected or all chains in one proposal .
"In addition , the TVL of Aave on Arbitrum is completely statistically insignificant ; however Arbitrum is one of the most amazing innovations / solutions within the space ."
"The fyTokens will be denominated in FRAX , with the initial liquidity and a backstop reserve seeded by the Frax protocol ."
"Fuji ’ s v2 takes some of the existing functionality of Fuji ’ s v1 ( borrowing aggregator ) , but enabling this to be done completely cross chain , and can also aggregate the lenders  so depositors are able to get the best yield , as well as the lowest interest rate for their onchain loans ."
We have an aggressive hiring plan to keep pace .
The remainder of the minimum fee will be paid via a year long Sablier stream .
"Maker won ’ t be here for a long time unless we grow up and : Improve internal checks and balances Seek proactive conversations with regulators Improve drastically our governance model Minimise complexity Ensure a significant capital cushion The alternative is RAI+ , a permissionless lower vol derivative product on $ ETH ."
Liquidity providers receive 2 BPs in the form of trading fees from Curve .
Sell… but into what liquidity ?
"Formal Verification of Smart Contracts during CI/CD The above rules will be used by the Certora Prover , which will be available to all Compound platform developers ."
How are protocols ...
"Here ’ s a cool animation for the ETH USDC 0.05 percent pool made by Austin Adams from the Uniswap research team : https : //twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1559621941903990784 This pool is more actively managed , and a larger fraction of the deployed liquidity is “ hugging ” the spot price ."
"Theoretically , all value transfers can be routed through one asset ( e.g ."
Now for our thoughts on the proposal .
That translates to 100 dollars in supply for each reward dollar spent if all unprofitable positions would close .
"Software development platforms aren ’ t new , and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories ( Rust , .Net , TypeScript , etc ) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long term , big picture strategy ."
"As a good faith partnership action , there will be an ACRE airdrop to all FXS holders who votes on this proposal if this vote passes ."

"UI/UX upgrade governance framework We voted YES : Pretty simple move , benefits are worth it ."
Possibly in combination with the release of their tokens .
"If the goal is to uncover elasticity of users to the real interest rates and reserve factors , then we should not add additional inflation to the interest rates by increasing COMP reward spend ."
When can we expect the snapshot vote to start ?
"So basically I think this is a good comparison in the sense that it frames the Endgame Plan as the choice that Maker should NOT be like a country or a government , and that we should take steps to permanently and provably prevent the possibility of such extreme scope creep from ever happening ."
"This contract is conceptually designed to only hold AAVE funds to be allocated by the community for distribution of governance power to other entities , for example , participants on the Aave V2 Ethereum , or participants of the Safety Module ."
"45 percent of OP tokens have been allocated to an Optimism Ecosystem Fund ( 25 percent ) and Retroactive public goods funding ( 20 percent ) ( here ) An unpublished portion of ~22 percent of dYdX were allocated to current and future employees and consultants of the Foundation ( here ) ~26 percent of GRT was allocated to The Graph Foundation , educational programs , and grants ( here ) 25 percent of CELO was allocated to Community and Operational Grants ( here ) 12.5 percent of SOL was allocated to the Solana Foundation ( here ) The Ethereum Foundation holds a treasury of $ 1.6B ( here ) What happens to UGP and the UGP Subcommittees ?"
I agree wholeheartedly .
"Perhaps for this reason , we see low rates of participation in Maker governance , as we do in many physical world settings ( examples include low rates of voter participation in many political elections ; the difficulty of getting people to run for office in many democracies ; and the low rates of participation in shareholder governance for publicly traded corporations . )"
"GFX Labs is planning to propose a similar program for USDC and USDP , though they are more complex from MakerDAO ’ s perspective , and require more time and collaboration to prepare ."
Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset ?
"We will provide periodic updates on our progress , so the community can get a clear sense of whether it wants to make this decision ."
"I ’ ve been using it for my own projects , I used it to build tools to aid in the recovery of the proposal 62 bug , and work is underway to adapt Compound protocol to use it ."
Thanks for the post
we should wait for the information before we vote .
"However , out of an abundance of caution , we propose pausing supply for the above assets , given their relative liquidity profiles ."
"Según su propio punto de vista , ¿qué diferencia a MakerDAO del resto de las comunidades o plataformas–de características similares–que gestionan el acuñamiento y la gestión de criptomonedas ?"
Its a seperate legal entity with its own 3 year sandbox protection .
The Treasury is not going to care about our RWA exposure when issuing sanctions .
"In summary , we think that Wormhole is the most implementation ready out of many providers we examined , but in terms of the model , it isn ’ t there just yet ( because of adjustments before its model passes our checks and balances ) ."
"An “ examination ” , or risk evaluation will come should the community be so inclined ."
"dbraut : Yes , we are !"
"HVBank will be the Servicer and , as needed , the Special Servicer , utilizing HVBank ’ s full Servicing Departments and Special Servicer expertise , which handles nearly one billion dollars of annual loan transactions ."
"As an alternative , Maker could use a structured price feed including NFTX floor token liquidity and NFT sales , with additional safeguards against outlier trade prices or attempted manipulation ."
Although I do agree that “ forcing ” users to deposit into every boost enabled LP paints a path to a healthy market   where no specific LP pool dominates in TVL and emissions .
"See here for the full thread Llama < > Aave Proposal So yeah , there the link between AGD and @ Llamaxyz is something the community should question ."
We would be glad to offer our analytic team ’ s time and effort to the Compound community as well if there is a need/opportunity in support of this discussion .
The mint introduces vesting YFI to new and existing contributors .
"This proposal makes tradeoffs , which if passed will provide additional data to glean from subsequent user behavior ."
We plan to distribute STAX platform fees to $ STAX stakers .
It is only fair to be really transparent about it for everybody to know .
"Eumenes : Backup servicers , when required , are there to replace the primary servicer if needed ."
We considered the following metrics and assessed the risk factors based on the existing params of other assets on Aave ( like UNI ) .
The BTC Stable pool receives around 4.07 percent vAPR in BAL rewards .
Everyone grows and succeeds together .
Im all for helping with anything related to this proposal then !
"Contributors are only allowed to participate with one ethereum wallet address in the program , which can only have one single ve YFI lock at any time ."
With regards to Construction loans .
@ guil lambert ’ s comment on tracking the ETH stable trades via the SwapRouter before and after fee switch would be a good addition .
"If the Frax AMO is already taking on the risk by being an LP , it could just LP its own FST if there is revenue to be made ."
"Already high ETH utilization causes regular ETH suppliers to start withdrawing their ETH As a result of the uncertainty and risks related to the ETHPoW fork and PoS merge in general , and ETH utilization on Aave in particular , current liquidity providers may become increasingly worried about their ETH on Aave , and in turn , may withdraw ETH on the supply side ."
Maybe the partnership could include some promotional/educational material to help crypto users utilize Frax .
I hope you are correct .
The incentives from the Celo foundation are the cherry on top .
"Each pool is associated with an SPV ( special purpose vehicle ) , an Operating Agreement , and Financing Agreement ."
We believe this conservative attitude needs to improve for us to thrive .
"As per the financial reports provided in the MIP 6 , deposits spiked in 2020 to $ 730MM ( and then fell in 2021 to $ 464MM ."
"These layers/security measures are divided into a few groups : Measures built into protocol design : State consistency validation ( simply speaking   validation of balance sheets ) Nonce sequence validation ( to prevent and instantly detect 51 percent attacks , reorgs , problems with consensus ) Strict transaction finality rules Isolated security model for every chain ( potential vulnerability in one chain shouldn ’ t influence liquidity locked in others ) Off chain validation ( validators don ’ t need to communicate with each other and expose their IP addresses and overall infrastructure ) Off chain measures : Monitoring scripts and backstop mechanism ( to Pause the protocol if critical monitorings triggered ) Security audits Code reviews and work out flows of how code is delivered into production Bug bounty campaigns Decentralized protocol authority key management These are some points that we ’ ve implemented in deBridge ."
"We are pleased to see the community taking the important first step to further manage risk following today ’ s events on the protocol , especially with rigour ."
TVL ( supply ) of DAI and USDT is where we ’ d expect to observe the primary impact .
Being able to borrow long tail assets against USDC above 80 percent is really not safe .
As a result of this feedback we came to the realization that our original proposal was deeply flawed .
The total period to discuss and vote will remain the same .
LOVE 001 ( in incubation and currently voted by governance ) has already provided its second opinion on this point   here .
"In fact , I ’ m excited to see how Goldfinch will integrate with future Frax primitives such as FraxLend in the future ."
"By allocating the proposed funds , we want to achieve a level of rigor in covering all fronts of making the fee switch enablement a success to UNI holders ."
They are still highly successful with the highest take rate of any market place .
Do both of these bridges support arbitrary message passing ?
"FRAX governance whitelists certain addresses ( which could be RWA protocols , or pool delegates , or even smart contracts with rules ) to use the funds from this pool , up to some cap per address ."
"Something to take into account is that for migrations v2 → v3 to happen via flash loans , highly probable will be necessary to have some liquidity already bootstrapped into v3 ."
"Taking economically , A rational LPs will only do it if they can find a better alternatives , which I consider would be very difficult ."
Hi @ teej This : “ …RWA counterparties are alive and self interested : they want the best terms for themselves and the worst terms for MakerDAO… ” is perhaps oversimplifying the situation a bit .
"Update Summary After careful consideration and review , we would like to provide an update to some of the questions we received in our community AMA event with Uniswap ."
The Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave .
So thank you for you contribution .
Balancer V2 was also audited by OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits .
"From this experience , they observed fragmented liquidity throughout the blockchain space ; to solve this issue , they incubated the WOO Network to connect and provide all liquidity sources in a chain agnostic approach for institutional traders and retail investors ."
"There was a long forum discussion including bids from other competitors ( Trail of Bits , Chainsecurity ) last year when the partnership started that would give you more background on how the community decided on us as the best option ."
Although these could be accelerated through a more aggressive approach to protocol partnerships & by providing opportunities beyond collateralized debt positions for access to ib assets for users ( i.e .
"A great example are the following markets : BAT : $ 1.48m borrowed , $ 1.13m reserves ZRX : $ 1.08m borrowed , $ 0.43m reserves USDT : $ 487m borrowed , $ 3.07m reserves USDC : $ 304m borrowed , $ 13.26m reserves ETH : $ 11.73m borrowed , $ 0.79m reserves Given the markets above , should the protocol consider converting/migrating reserves from BAT/ZRX into USDT , etc , which has the worst ratio of borrowing/reserves ?"
"For each smart contract , the product will automatically generate inputs and check that the contract obeys the rule for those inputs ."
That should provide plenty of real data .
"Besides this , I think the proposal may have some merit if there are clearer incentives for Frax ."
Great question .
"Click the Actions tab at the top of the page and then the green button that says I understand my workflows , go ahead and enable them ."
"Moving forward , I ’ ll continue to play my part with financial restraint as much as possible during this challenging time for the DAO ."

They should not be representing the DAO .
"sambacha : This token migration fiction will be exceedingly hard to coordinate , and is bar far the most tenuous portion of this proposal ."
"If you have any feedback or suggestions for future research , feel free to reach out , also on Twitter https : //twitter.com/robin_ethz ."
Against : Do nothing AMENDMENT 6/12/22 FRAX FXS Gauge for this proposal should have a 1 year lock with 3x boost instead of the 3 year lock for 3x boost .
We also predict our grants budget will last approximately 3 years .
"Do we have any idea around the base asset itself yet , or is this being kept secret as part of the magic sauce ?"
Maybe someone more knowledgeable knows how this is mitigated .
Really a working group needs to be formed and funded to try to build rails towards a vision of the future that legislators and regulators can get on board with .
"Uniswap ’ s community is expansive , encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols ."
Al menos para mí lo es .
"To encourage full transparency , we believe this decision to acquire a surplus of CRV would be best lived in a separate discussion ."
If the solution is : they have an identity NFT in their wallet so they can use Maker but it ’ s not required for other users… is that an issue ?
Both proposals will run in parallel with SP63 being contingent on SP62 .
Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits ( e.g .
"While fees obviously result from trading activity , the way orders are routed play an important role in how much volume each pool gets ."
"I think this also goes back to trialing the mechanism : if the next iteration of the Guild had , say , 4Y vesting , we want to make sure the process works as expected with just a 1Y vest ."
"As a result , a token that has a pause and/or a blacklist function ( like USDC ) will fail the “ transfer should always work ” rule In the case of ERC20 , the point of these rules is usually to present precise information about the token behavior to the community ."
This caused a short increase in ETH/MKR ratio .
Those who advocate for burning are actually those who believe there is value in buying at the current prices because we believe the value will increase in the future .
"First , PLUTUS transactions are taxed at a rate of 3 percent , 2 percent of which is converted to the 1DAI stablecoin and routed to the bank and 1 percent is burned forever ."
Grants and hackathons – decided by the Aave Grants DAO   will be a key part of the strategy to build out these mainstream use cases .
"There ’ s a dearth of this type of research , but it ’ s hugely impactful to ensure that DAOs exercise best practices and encourage growth and quality output ."
"Here is a query showing historic weekly job fees assuming a 1 percent fee , and also another one assuming 10 percent job fees ."
sparkes25 : maybe split the airdrop over a 12 month time frame Perhaps as a supplement to our 60m community allocated FXS we could have FPI as yield ?
Each simulation run forks from a specified block height ( default block height is the most recent ) so that your inputs include up to date account balances and the latest smart contracts and code deployed across DeFi .

"We know that there is incredible work of cost reduction for storage proofs happening on Starknet , so it is highly probable that this will happen in the following 2 3 months ."
Do you have someone in mind from the community who can potentially take up such a role ?
Thanks so much for the extremely detailed guideline !
"[ ARC ]   ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral Status : Discussion Author : @ llamaxyz , @ MatthewGraham @ Dydymoon Created : 24 10 2022 Summary @ Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves ."
We will look into whether this is possible .
Having a ragequit function would change that calculation and for that sake I do think only valuing the locked liquidity that has the option to ragequit at 20 percent locked is the right way to assess it .
"Secondly and much more importantly , having a protocol owned vault allows Maker to more directly control and impact how negative the rates are allowed to get , helping stabilize the free floating Dai and protect users against the uncertainty of randomly getting hit by extremely negative rate because of some demand or supply shock ."
"But burning , to me , is actually actually a sign that the protocol believes in itself and it ’ s future growth ."
At this point in time the Reserve Rights ( RSR ) token serves as a placeholder token .
Expressing my support of this proposal — Llama / Shreyas and team have helped pushed the industry forward by offering treasury management support for DAOs .

Gauntlet recommends that options 1 and 3 are the most prudent options .
We ’ ll continue to keep the community updated as we work with the Pause Guardian and other Compound participants to ensure the resolution is as smooth as possible .
Whether this something is worth knowing ?
OpenZeppelin ’ s feedback above is intended to be neutral on Certora ’ s proposal since we believe this needs to be guided by Compound ’ s vendor selection process .
"But actually , this is not really accurate at the moment , because not all that supply is able to vote : AAVE deposited on Aave v2 Ethereum ( aAAVE ) is not able to vote , accounting for 16.7 percent of the supply or ~2 ’ 673 ’ 000 AAVE ."
So it ’ s clear that this wouldn ’ t work for every pair otherwise we ’ d be cutting our locked liquidity into 1/5th of what it was .

Very nice usage of Uniswap v3 concentrated liquidity model .
"Pro case : We believe that , over time , this allocation mechanism would bring material diversification , growth and moats to Uniswap – the three goals stated above ."
We believe all three of these metrics should be actively tracked .
"Or , it can run without requiring any permissions , and simply provide information–such as liquidation alerts ."
With the current proposal we are changing this to spending the AMO earnings on voting power and rewarding FRAXbp users and excluding veFXS holders from having a direct share of the profits .
Let ’ s assume ETH borrow gets disabled but ETH supply withdrawals start to occur for some reason and utilization starts increasing towards 100 percent .
"This bootstrapping was proposed to be executed in 2 phases : an initial one getting in touch with the new technology , while still building something valuable for the Aave and Starknet communities ; and a second one , more ambitious , most probably porting Aave v3 to Starknet ."
Derek : ongoing treasury discussions Where are we in these discussions ?

We believe that a partnership with Frax would allow us to continue to access the true potential of Real Estate together .
"However , we suggest that any governance proposal that does not entail an on chain action ( e.g ."
"Would it be possible to reserve some of the AAVE used to instead buy ETH to pair with the BAL , allowing for adding liquidity proportionally ?"
Any continuous engagement in that direction will create really difficult situations for the community to choose between “ profit ” and risk .
Finally which lower lever decisions can be resolved by the day to day representative such as a Trustee ?

"In conclusion , the following parameter changes to the Aave Ethereum v2 ETH market are proposed in the interim period leading up to the merge : 1 ) Freeze ETH borrowing ."
"Once mainnet Aave v3 launch is complete , I would urge the community to revisit taking this step if it has not already done so prior ."
The amount of red tape and bureaucracy that we ’ d be creating for ourselves with this type of system would be epic .
"However , one thing that we ’ ll need to accept is that not everything is measurable as a direct ROI ."

how we measure the impact of increased Twitter activity for example .
"One more example , Uniswap : we are only about 1/10 the size of Uniswap in treasury valuation , so a Uniswap sized contribution ( also $ 5M request ) seems incorrectly weighted ."
"It is envisioned that such contributions would not have a significant impact on costs for the protocols , and that any costs could reasonably be expected to be offset by increased user growth"
The Brief is being done and will also have inputs from the brand research which will give us clarity around positioning and product placement .
"At Monetalis clearly we are less well capitalised than JP Morgan Chase , can not show a 10 Trillion dollar AuM like BlackRock or the long term , global , consistent high return “ chops ” of Goldman ."
Comparing RoE with Net Income One consequence of using RoE over broader profitability metrics ( like net income ) is that it allows optimizing the amount in the Surplus Buffer as well .
A security checklist and more formal listing process is the ultimate outcome of this audit that could then be used by all other asset listing proposers .

Talking to engineers involved in the development of advanced developer tooling could be helpful to understand the relevance and cost of our work from an unbiased point of view .
"I have to say , I was surprised to see the turnout / result of the Snapshot vote without much feedback left in this discussion ."
I featured this on the first edition of UniSwap Vibes .
This means the risk of bridge hacks and bridge risk is entirely offloaded to LPs of these bridge pools that pair canFRAX with different wrapped versions of FRAX bridged from Ethereum .
"An independent , reputable , third party to serve as paying agent ( i.e ."
"Otherwise , this is a lot of complexity for an effectively unsecured loan ."
I would assume that sophisticated LPs tend to sit in lower fee tiers as a result of low demand for their liquidity .
"On this point ( emphasis added ) : rune : In the long run , the protocol can still do RWA collateral even if Phoenix Stance , but it has to be “ Physically Resilient RWA ” that is not possible to simply seize through a legal or political order by a global authority ."

"Since the last proposal , our spending has been as follows : $ 328,200 for grants , primarily funding applications and integrations on Aave $ 100,000 for xSushi bounty to support security researchers who helped with the incident $ 634,000 for events , primarily major crypto events and hackathons to build the developer ecosystem $ 263,000 for raave The remaining difference from the total $ 2 million received was back paid for expenses and grants owed from 2021 , used to cover operational costs , and realized losses due to the AAVE price decline between when the funds were originally received and the payments executed ."
"We believe that together , Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets ."
"I would also add the following fields : “ EVM compatibility ” , “ Block explorer ” , “ RPC Details ” and “ Faucet ” link to Technical specifications ."
Which isnt exactly a simple solution but probably doable at some point .
"Programs such as USDA , Main Street ( if revived ) , and IDA/EDC loans would be defined as part of this category ."
"Grow the treasury with safe , attractive yield that is truly uncorrelated with the rest of the crypto markets ."
"It may also leave the system more vulnerable to governance attacks , among other issues , as research about Maker by some of my Stanford colleagues explores ."
"Generally agree with the proposed changes , which should provide immediate mitigation of risk from long tail assets outweighing impact on UX ."
Whitehackers can insert bugs into the code before it is deployed and see if the current rules suffice .
"For the sake of this proposal , it is simply assumed that there is some group of contributors getting some compensation , which is allocated in some pre determined way ."
A non exhaustive list of questions that I think need more definitive answers : Where did the on chain liquidity for CRV come from in preparation for the liquidations ?
"tongnk : we can tweak is potentially paying some interest ( say 5 percent in PERP ) , reducing the time ( say 3 months instead of 6 to build trust up ) or maybe reducing the amount ( say 7m instead of 10m ) the time frame and amount dont really bother me , the idea of handing out interest free loans does ."

"The token tracker page also shows the ... you can see that in the top 5 holdings ( ignoring the first ) , it ’ s addresses without debt and addresses with stable wETH debt , meaning when this proposal is getting executed there ’ s a high incentive to move to e.g ."
Long term solution : It ’ s become clear to me during the past few months that lack of vendor and project management disciplines will have an adverse impact on the survivability of the “ DAO ” model .

We do have one stipulation we ’ d like to put forward .
"I am preparing a dashboard about the Uniswap LM program phase 1   But I couldn ’ t get 'how these incentivizes being used ’ for example , if I had deposited some amount to USDC/WETH 0.5 pool ( directly on uniswap ) am I eligible for some $ OP rewards or do I have to deposit through Gamma , xToken or Arrakis ?"
its an innovative offering and the will only drive further demand for FRAX and FXS .
"Second , this partnership announcement does not involve adding another centralized stablecoin Peg Stability Module The system already has a GUSD PSM ."
This is a relatively small percentage of UNI supply compared to the percentage of tokens allocated to Foundation and Grant programs by other protocol teams .
"Following publication , we remain available to organise a session on the proposal with MKR delegates or broader community if required ."
"After careful review and monitoring the stETH situation , I ’ ve noticed the “ de peg ” hovering mostly in lines of 4 5 percent between ETH and stETH ."

"Instead this should be actively managed ( by a treasury committee for example ) to decide the amount of vote needed for each pool , create the quests , try to maintain target APR for the SM , contact big stakeholders to vote etc Also , it ’ s important to say that even if Aave voting power holdings are currently low and not very impactful right now , but the yield generated by Aave DAO POL in the SM would earn an important voting power over the next months if locked ."
"Thanks in advance For clarity , you ’ d like over all asset performance from these periods or just resi mortgage performance ?"
"Clearly , every initiative that implies additional risks will need to be formalized through a clear business case and submitted to the community vote before execution ; as always , the quality of the collateral and the robustness of the legal contracts should remain a key priority for the protocol as DAI holders ’ trust is our most precious asset ."
"New Comp Model Previously we were spending 1,419,342.9 DAI/month and 0 YFI/month on comp , not counting the 200,000 DAI/month sent to the strategists multisig to pay interns ."

"What Chaos is proposing in this thread is that low , impact incremental changes also fall under the scope of the Risk Council – I think this probably makes sense assuming that the changes fit very well defined , DAO approved criteria and the changes are communicated on a transparent basis ( the current state of affairs is that governance is bogged down with parameter changes that take too long to change and usually always get 100 percent “ yes ” rate ) ."
That doesn ’ t seem to be in our interest at all .

The most important being : Fossil → Starknet messaging bridge .
"This will be an iterative process that will take years , so we have to properly incentivize stakeholders to stick it out for the long term vision of MakerDAO ."
We wrote the proposal to communicate it to the community in terms that are digestible to stakeholders and not to overcomplicate it with unnecessary technical jargon ( which we have expanded upon above ) .
Let me know if you have any suggestions !
"An additional upside and source of long term income is that we can provide all of our in house projects for other MetaDAOs to copy , and in return pay our MetaDAO a revenue share under the Plug and Play Protocol model ."
"They are achieving great goals , working hard to establish more partnerships such as Ripple , XinFin and Algorand , and boosting EURS liquidity ."

That without adding that the Makerdao page is managed by a Venezuelan belonging to the community and is still very active .
Both of these groups ( at least to date ) lack adequate underwriting skills/experience to make reasonable RWA underwriting decisions .
This extensive list of media articles includes mentions of MakerDAO or the Maker Protocol in articles that are not focused on Maker   meaning that we have been observing the use of the Maker brand as either an example in DeFi or as a partner involved in other projects within the ecosystem .
"After 4th October Voting on both proposals opens , with “ boost ” lasting 3 days , and Level 2 lasting 10 days ."
"Agree 1000 percent with the sentiment , but what ’ s the call to action ?"
"The protocol is asset class agnostic and has created pools for assets such as mortgages , invoices and consumer finance ."
"Therefore we must understand which risks are specific to Uniswap governance , and how the use of a bridge would change the risk profile associated with these various parameters ."
But borrowing ETH against USDC and CRV against USDC are two very different things .
As well as streaming app for fire/chrome sticks .
Not decentralised at all .
FXS holders benefit as a direct result since ANZ tokens would go toward the protocol balance sheet just like prior investments such as OHM and CVX .
"All I am saying is that I think we should be careful about allowing unilateral interpretations of conflicting provisions like these , and making assumptions on what the community may/may not have understood they were agreeing to when voting ."
That action will immediately decrease reserve growth for that market and slightly increase Supply rate for that market .
The whole point of my post is that I am suggesting NO PLAN for how these accrued tokens might be used .
"There is a ton of research , not to mention our humble experience , that passive LPing on Uni V3 does not work ."
"Therefore , I think the premium should generally be tuned to account for how much we believe that oracle prices can be off by in a big market downturn , and to compensate for high gas costs ."

"All that things are quite well known by that point : Having treasury supply of native tokens ( COMP ) for incentivize programs Having deep treasury reserves , nominated in non protocol tokens like stable cons , eth , wbtc , possibly some others ."
This moves the borrower ’ s collateral to the protocol balance sheet and reduces reserves to cover the entire borrow .
@ rune Thanks for putting this post together .
Now ill address the risk question .

"836×312 18.3 KB Closing As a sumary , FraxP shouldn ’ t use an additional $ 20m to buyback FXS because : ( 1 ) FraxP can be seen as an early stage startup which has not found market yet , expenses should be focused in finding this market , ( 2 ) FraxP is not profitable , so although it is able to afford a $ 20m expenditure , it should be very weary of how to use it because it has a decreasing runway , ( 3 ) it is a temporary relieve that does not benefit long term investors , ( 4 ) FraxP is already spending big amounts of its revenue in FXS1559 buybacks ."
We don ’ t hold sufficiently many $ COMP to weight in the balance .
Allowing stakers to leave for a 20 percent fee on strategically selected pools does not mean all of a sudden only 20 percent of ALL locked pools should be considered “ true ” locked liquidity .

"I think this is a great proposal and opportunity for Frax , Optimism is a pioneer in optimistic rollups and Perpetual Protocol one of the biggest perpetuals DEX , Perp V2 on Optimism has over $ 70m in daily volume and almost $ 100k in daily fees ."
This is a new frontier on capturing yield from TradFi and we would like the Frax protocol to be in a good position for that new wave .
would they buy FXS on the open market if we dont do a swap with them ?
The limited cross interaction bottleneck is already being addressed by the Cross Core Unit & Stakeholder Alignment Initiative .
We are well equipped to handle the challenges facing the DAO ( and building these simulations at scale ) and are eager to prove it throughout this engagement .
"Compound v3 As long term Compound participants , we are looking forward to seeing Compound Labs bring Wednesday ’ s announcement of v3 to life ."
Also I didn ’ t mean use aave frax on eth .
Or perhaps   more realistically for now   a “ compromise tier 2 debt instrument ” could be constructed with some hard cash plus drawing right plus minted DAI in custody .
This proposal is currently being voted on .
"We need to onboard protocols like Maple , TrueFi and others which are solely focused on connecting RWA borrowers to on chain lenders ."
I hope they grant this to the Hermes Team ! !

"The credit model would serve to allow Frax to manage additional FRAX in the market , generating additional profit for veFXS stakers , while remaining far less susceptible to real and imagined risks ."
If this budget gets voted in then the team will have permission to use the budget any way they choose as long as its being used to help FRAXswap gain liquidity and/or users .
It would be my deep honor to contribute .
"However , over time we have been funding more events and community projects ."

• Offering the flexibility for yield to be returned in another form can draw in additional depositors and grow TVL .
"However , the Endgame Plan seems to take this complexity and ratchet it up a hundred notches , preserving the protocol ’ s existing high barriers to entry and adding things like : rune : Singularity Engine tokenomics and vault engine , the Elixir wars tokenomics synergy , the $ MANO token for Maker ’ s oracle and staking network , the MetaShard Maker rollup [ etc ] This seems like an extremely complicated reform   that isn ’ t necessarily a bad thing , but it ’ s not clear to me how it makes governance easier for either MKR holders or DAI holders ?"

My only concern is finding 5 members of the community with such knowledge who are already not contributors to the DAO in some form or another and have no conflict of interest with other DAOs .
"It is also important to note that any Core Unit members that join M0 , including the Deco Core Unit members will not be “ adopted ” by M0 ( meaning they will not continue to work as Maker Core Unit but managed and with results guarantee from M0 , which is a functionality other MetaDAOs can have ) ."

Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi in the Binance ecosystem .
"Going off TVL locked in Gauge ’ d contracts ( which isn ’ t the whole picture but is informative ) about 1/5 of the total liquidity is in pools the size of Temple Frax or smaller , so given the first point above this change would result in a decrease of 16 percent or pessimistically up to 20 percent of Frax ’ s locked LP ."

Great initiative from Arcology !
Comparing RoE with Return over Asset ( RoA ) Another metric that can be used is Return over Asset ( RoA ) .

We can provide a full reference implementation that is ready for review by the Uniswap community and security auditing firms .
Now we can test run the migration in simulate mode as a proposer .
The FRAX   FXS pool is rarely used by the protocol since the buyback / recollateralize functions where adjusted so the AMO ’ s take up the slack .
Community Agent Access Sure CL Products Allow the Aave community to access agent modules for feedback and discussion around the most relevant user types to better test protocol .

"Aave has seen a myriad of contributors over these years , but there is still a lack of more teams with the knowledge , mission/values , and trustworthiness to take care of the core technical tasks of the ecosystem ."
ibXXX are not in short supply .
"Yes , that RF increase for WBTC and ETH isn ’ t going to be forever , of course ."
the more FXS earns the more each FXS will become .
"If we are looking to grow Aave 10x , it comes with more scalable ways for people to engage ."
Looking forward to seeing the numbers when this passes a governance vote .
"This obviously isn ’ t the case for traditional finance , smart contract auditing , web2 cyber security , etc ."
"The proposal correctly specifies the total stream amount as 21,213 COMP ."
"Legal contracts stipulate that borrowers must pay into the smart contracts , and the smart contracts enforce that the Senior Pool is paid first ."
"Another concern of high ETH utilization is that in an extreme case where large amount of stETH liquidity is pulled from Curve or Balancer , the liquidators wouldn ’ t be able to source enough on chain liquidity to liquidate stETH/ETH recursive positions ."
YFI price volatility makes vesting unfair .
"Awarded grant will be going towards two sets of events an in person event and an online event Events Summary To date , AGD has sponsored multiple different events directly and indirectly since its start in May of 2021 ."
Cast your vote on Snapshot .
"Question to @ CB_Institutional and @ strat fin core unit : is this proposal consistent with the Endgame construct currently proposed by @ rune ( eg continuous reduction of USDC exposure , reduction of central attack vectors vs regulator , etc ) or is alternative to that ?"
For more information on UGP ’ s past work and grantees check out the following links : UGP Homepage ( still accepting applications ! )
Liability type and tenor may not provide a good match for the asset structure .
"The trend for transaction prices on L2s goes down , there is still a lot of optimization that can be done plus there is datasharding coming , reducing the prices even more ."
"With some older pools having either dropped significantly in APY or the assets in the LP having become increasingly risky to hold , we ’ re seeing an increasing number of people asking for unlocks or some way to get out of these “ dead ” and/or “ risky ” gauges ."
"BTW , there is also an official discord & telegram group"
"more reasons to vote yes to kill the gauge , Polygon is not that secure !"
"EURS is now a euro backed stablecoin with multi chain support , so we really plan to target various markets ."
"If there is a curve pool , will not the bad price beg of these , just cause the UNI pool to be arbed into off peg zones anyway ?"
"What attracts me to this space is the speed of innovation , new products & ideas , novel methods and I simply love testing and checking new offerings / projects ."
"That ’ s because LPs would relocate to a more profitable pool if that were the case , and more liquidity in a pool decreases overall revenue , leading to other opportunities in other pools , etc ."
"Note , users may change any votes already placed during the discussion period should sentiment change based on the nature of the debate Please also note , the results of the poll are not considered binding & must be ratified by further governance stages as outlined in the ‘ governance ’ sections below Finally , to be clear the intent is to establish a 30 percent level of support for this proposal overall ( i.e ."
We see rewards rates for the other stablecoins becoming non zero .
This is enough veBAL to support $ 2.66M with max boost on before the boost reduces .
Net yield is defined as yield owed to the Trust net of servicing fees payable to HVB .
I ’ ve been utilizing and following Bilira # TRYB for a long time .
The RWF CU will seek support from professional legal intermediaries senior/experienced in customary practice in these jurisdictions to benchmark a transaction against a market standard practice .
It is interesting to have another entity that contributes to Uniswap and helps to shift the balance of power which imo leans too much towards uniswap labs .
"The challenges As with any development , but especially with one of this magnitude , we did a deep analysis of what would be required for this v2→v3 upgrade ."
Lever 3   Multi Chain Expansion The current major crypto effort of building and scaling new cost efficient networks ( i.e .
"In preparation for tomorrow ’ s proposal , here ’ s the passing proposal simulation : https : //github.com/TylerEther/compound protocol/blob/halve comp rewards/spec/sim/0012 halve comp rewards/hypothetical_proposal.sim All COMP reward rates except for supplying COMP are halved ."
Those answers will be incorporated by the risk assessments .
We are conducting analysis on the market risk implications for these supply cap increases and aim to return to the forums next week .
What ’ s important is being able to allow users to use Compound protocol without having to pay ridiculous gas prices relative to the amount of capital they ’ re working with .
Again good for you but why have you not said one constructive thing either criticism or input
"The value , the utility and the identity of $ ASH is balanced by its users ."
Full support from me on this .
"Similar to how the media can inform voters , when parties or interest groups support a particular delegate or a vote on a particular issue , it can signal to voters who share their preferences that this is something they should support ."
Is there a roadmap to bring the actual loan docs into smart contract based structures ?
Morpho Labs continues to believe that the Compound protocol should not only consider risk for upcoming proposals but also the utility constraints of the protocol .
"As of February 2021 , the syste…"
"It requires a clear , direct response ."
"Therefore , a more aggressive interest rate increase for the ETH market is proposed ."
A few thoughts : Great that Gauntlet ’ s insolvency fund covers some of the bad debts .
"Assuming a UNI price of $ 7.04 * , this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI ."
This is consistent with RWF ’ s role as described by the MIP67 ( i.e .
I ’ ve been following this project for two and a half years .
Proposals Risk Parameter Updates 2022 10 26 ( 133 ) .
Thanks @ lisa   the opportunity to make Compound accessible again to smaller market participants is what pushed me over the edge to double down on Solidity skill building so that I could draft this bridge .
See this thread for previous discussion on the topic .
Sorry my English is not best .
"In overall , what is important to consider is the timelines ."
"Loan Eligibility Ankura Trust , as calculation agent , will provide an independent , third party review to confirm if a loan meets the eligibility requirements ."
"1600×320 126 KB Furthermore , as mentioned before , in a scenario when DAO ’ s revenue 10x but price stays still , just a threat of ( massive ) burn should be enough to increase price and hence such scenario should never occur ."
Wouldn ’ t happen to be in pediatrics by any chance ?
"i would agree to this , but feel a longer timeframe would make a bigger difference , maybe split the airdrop over a 12 month time frame ."
Here is how to get started .
"Advanced account management tools , which can enable new UX patterns and applications on top of the protocol ."
The traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem .
?
"The Focus Objectives represent the overall most impactful developments that the Core Units prioritize , following a “ waterfall ” approach where thigns are prioritized at the top of the list and resources can only flow to objectives that are lower on the list if higher ranked objectives have all their needs fulfilled ."
"These are a starting point for almost any cross chain liquidity development that requires the minimization of “ active ” communication between chains , as by its nature , a holder of those tokens ( both on Ethereum or after bridging somewhere else ) will be passively accumulating yield from Aave on Ethereum ."
Hope to still see you around my fren
This sounds promising .
"if everyone chooses their own lock in , then contributors will have very different amounts of alignment to YFI from none to 100 percent ."
Awesome stuff !
On Chain Liquidation Process : MIP 21 .
"Additionally , some liquidity providers feel that the content of proposals is often not structured in a way that engages readers and contains non important material ."
"Contract date of deployment : • Original contract : ( May 17th 2019 ) : Ethereum Transaction Hash ( Txhash ) Details | Etherscan • New contract : ( January 5th 2022 ) : Ethereum Transaction Hash ( Txhash ) Details | Etherscan Number of transactions : • Original contract : ~332K • New contract : ~51K Number of token holders : • ~50,7K unique on chain wallets ( as Etherscan is event based , the “ Holders ” tab on the new RSR contract does not show all holders , only those who have performed a transaction since January 2022 ; the old contract does still show the amount of holders the RSR token had on January 13th , 2022 . )"
"To begin , this should be restricted to a few assets ( max 5 ) on a specific market like v3 AMM , this would allow to not totally dilute the very low voting power owned by the DAO at the moment ."
"Proposal data is stored on the Voting contract on Starknet , storing the block hash , proposal id and any other metadata needed ."
Attract new active users ( LPs ) to the protocol in order to facilitate long term growth after incentives are shut off .
"By construction , reducing the amount of equity is relutive to RoE if , and only if , the price of MKR ( $ 2000 as of writing ) is below the equity per MKR ( $ 75 as of writing ) ."
A waterfall approach in project management ( typically contrasted with agile ) means something different .
Specification : UNI has been assigned a loan to value ratio of 49 percent on the platform .
"Based upon this snapshot and the Voting Rules and Information section of Convex ’ s documentation , we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate ."
Something important to point out is that the rates we set are essentially APR whereas the protocol actually pays/charges APY and compounds each block .
30 percent fee + ( ( number of days left/365 ) * 70 percent ) Non critical to me is anything the AMOs don ’ t touch .
We believe this would be a great stepping stone to achieving that state .
"First of all , the blockchain industry completely and utterly failed to produce anything of value during the bull run ."
"There will be a GovComms internal coordination meeting on the education/onboarding initiative where SES , Talent , and Academy ( maybe a few others , I forget ) are meeting ."
Turning the fee switch would make uniswap less competitive because of reduced LP profits ( less TVL and more slippage ) .
"Just as the rails for crypto loans were being laid then , so the rails for RWAs are being laid now ."
You can see the codebase and specification of the system on the official repository HERE What was being done since the last update ?
So I don ’ t see why changing rates through governance is a pain for the protocol operations .
"When Maker makes a senior secured loan to a Borrower , how will Maker know that the collateral backing the loan is valid ?"
Thank you for taking initiative on this !
JJ18 : We have gone through every length to continue to build and stay within all laws how can this be if you dont know the laws ?
"This work has centered around Gateway , a stand alone distributed ledger with “ starports ” on external chains , used to connect these assets ."
"Naturally , when Aave v3 and E Mode arrives , we will be able to accommodate this as well ."
"Regarding your question on the topic of team composition , we plan to onboard members as see fit and based on elements that require addressing before pushing a proposal on toggling the fee switch ."
"If the proposal is accepted by the community , we will chart out a more detailed plan on how to setup a domain allocators and the processes to review their performance ."
"With a mission to provide # DeFiForAll , Polygon aims to provide an extremely cheap yet secure DeFi experience for users across the globe , regardless of wealth status ."
yRates is completely the opposite : giving power to a small group of ppl compared to now .
"This seems like three separate proposals in one : use Gauntlet ’ s insolvency refund acquire 2,651,906 CRV at a market value of $ 1,877,777 redeem the v2 Collector Contract for a total value of $ 434,299 Now that these are more explicit   I ’ d like to drill into # 2 : We are supportive of using the insolvency refund and think that is a no brainer ."
"On the other hand , most new EVM chains have not built their own bridging solution ( Solana , Moonbeam , etc ) and are already relying on third party bridges ."
Relevant addresses are linked below : Audits : GitHub   1inch/1inch v2 audits 1inch Genesis : 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f Burn 1INCH Key Transaction : 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511 1INCH Counterparty Risk : 1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed .
"The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110 percent , increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol ."
It is almost certain given the previous grantees that the contributions of Chaos Labs would be really strong candidates to receive grants .
"Apart from the BGD testing work itself , we estimate at minimum 1 1.5 months of SigmaPrime , and weeks on the Certora side ; given that there is not really a precedent of a “ hot ” upgrade of this caliber on a DeFi protocol ."
This is an example of a dashboard that I think we need to create for the fee switch pools .
so 10 percent of FXS ( $ 127m ) + $ 127m FRAX = $ 254m total in value .
Having two distinct risk managers poses some key questions for the community .
"Summary I propose we commit some time to investigating if we can build a single coin , locked , auto compounding staking option on the BSC for FXS ( with no voting rights ) If we can build it then we build it with up to 3 years lock time we offer rewards boost for longer locks we add the pool to the new FRAX UI staking list we redirect 10 percent of the veFXS rewards to this pool Voting options For = action this proposal Against = do nothing"
Add stMATIC on Aave V3 Pool on Polygon Proposal to list stMATIC on Aave V3 ’ s Polygon pool .
"For commercial real estate , properties generally are higher than normal risk but cash flow and asset values are intact ."
I look forward to this happening !
"Before we dive into the discussion , let ’ s recenter on why the reserve factor is a valuable parameter in the first place ."
"Given the low returns of borrows against the least liquid tokens , and the large total value locked in Aave and Compound , we feel taking active precautionary action is warranted even if the possibility of the attack is theoretical rather than certain , so long as it can not be proved infeasible ."
"Maker ’ s NFT lending strategy should take account of these external platforms to ensure we can meet the needs of high volume , high impact users ."
GUSD ’ s partnership offer more than meets the mark for Dai today .
It would be very complimentary given the recent MATIC risk parameter changes made .
The risks are contained within each individual smart contract and its respective corporate veil LLC so only the smart contract itself is at risk .
It ’ s hard to see how the delegates and the core units are really serving token holders in some of these things .
Pause Supply for Compound Assets We voted YAE : Voting yes as a safety precaution in light of recent news regarding price manipulation possibilities .
The stablecoins in the PSM are assets for MakerDAO and serve a function similar to the foreign exchange reserves held by central banks .
Maker would accept applications for collateral onboarding for liquid NFT set tokens ( eg .
"All of their code is fully public on their Github and they have benefited Aave by being one of the only sources of Aave V3 information across the 6 chains and one of the first to cover Aave V2 on Polygon and Avalanche Phi   $ 20,000 ( full )   applications and integrations “ Through the gamified familiarity of our application , Phi encourages new users to overcome the mental barrier of participating in Crypto ."
"To not get caught and become one of these projects , the Maker community should proactively respond to regulators , dismantling their legal case before they can bring it ."
We outline our process for evaluating a vendor and next steps .

"Overview For Background , hello everyone !"
"Primoz : Ideally we should think of implementing an upgrade to Liq 2.0 where auction ’ s throughput rate limiting works with a decay In the event of the price of ETH continuing to drop , would such a decay in the auction throughput not make things worse for Maker ?"
Is this just for bootstrapping and guaranteeing liquidity on startup ?
thanks for opening this topic .
"I think this type of research is hugely beneficial to the community , thank you ."
But why not expand to all chains ?
Cheers
Bottom line is that I support this request .
"Out of these , 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet , 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors ."
All other assets are collateral .
"My first thought though is that Nadia and her team should return their sights to market makers for MKR , like Wintermute ."
"In short , DeFi wins and users win ."
Hey Pablo from Angle Protocol here !
Why would it ?

"These are new structures and processes for embedding into Maker governance , and one must clearly plan for , and expect , unforeseen issues happening in practice , that will require adjustments , over the coming 12 months until a stable firm solution has evolved ."
—  Maker was a great idea from the outset .
Expected net yield for fixed rate assets : Like term US Treasury + 145 195 bps .
In response the collateral ratio was also increased .
Again we are actively working on this key issue .
One major problem for acquiring FST is that there is basically no existing market liquidity .
Or would a corporate guarantee from the parent of the originator qualify as third party liquidity ?
no investment or anything of the sort ) with Gauntlet or Chaos Labs .
"The proposal is important , forward looking and strongly supported ."
"There are three key needs that are driving an ongoing need for KP3R token emissions ; New KP3R required to rewards keepers working Keep3r Jobs Incentives needed to encourage deposits to Curve liquidity pools attracting yield seekers ( mining liquidity ) Compensating vested KP3R token holders for the dilution caused by the issuance of new supply in 1 & 2 Whilst the third need would be eliminated by implementation of ve ( 3,3 ) tokenomics this has not yet been put in place ."
"As I have closely followed Gauntlet ’ s offering during the past year , and interacted with them on several occasions so that their engagement brings more value to the community , here ’ re my thoughts : Gauntlet presents quantitative rigor to most of their analyses ."
"As a final parameter , setting reserve factor must balance all stakeholders ’ desire for solvency against higher spreads ( and corresponding higher borrow rate and/or lower supply rate ) caused by protocol reserve accrual ."
"A smaller initiative , that goes under the line of sponsorship , experimenting with PartyDAO and being able to send a NFT memento back into the treasury ."
Thanks !
"Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once , however , we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment , Moonbeam ."
"Huntington Valley Bank DAI Vault HVB x MakerDAO   TheBlock1120×1146 136 KB We are delighted to share that the recently announced deal with HVB has caught some attention in the media , and we arranged a commentary for TJ to represent Maker in this article from The Block ."
There is no other way .
This is one area where Maker can build upon the learnings of traditional finance .
"During the community call , we will push forward to achieve the following : Address immediate feedback from the community to improve CIP 1 Establish a group of CIP Editors that will shepard the CIP process Create a GitHub repository to contain CIP drafts and track progress Move to finalize CIP 1 and hold a COMP Signal Vote to mark its official adoption Encourage the creation of additional CIPs to capture existing processes and begin working on new improvement ideas ."
"Hardhat ’ s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack : Hardhat VSCode — programming editor Hardhat Ignition — contract deployment Hardhat Network — local development network Hardhat Runner — build/testing workflow This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs , and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins ."
From a voter ’ s perspective this process is far more streamlined and preferable ( two non binding votes is repetitive imo ) .

Would maker want to be the lender serving entities that by all means can not get a line of credit in the “ real world ” ?
Obviously we ’ d go on more chains and do more vaults/strategies .
I believe that refocus on growth is exactly what will make MKR price more speculative .
"Are we close , and have a launch date estimation ?"
critical bug that could lead to collateral being stolen/minting unbacked DAI ) .
"In order to do a proposal on Level 2 , we think it is important to have good initial support in terms of proposition power , but the current 2 percent ( 320 ’ 000 AAVE ) seems too strict ."
"The existence of deep , liquid , low cost debt markets for protocols could unlock a large number of new use cases , like investing in developers for protocol development , acquiring users , earning significant returns from yield farming , and more ."
"The planned main target of MZR yield farming rewards are MATH vaults , specifically debt of MATH Vaults ."
What kind of legal entity will UF be ?
"Additionally , Celo has been chosen by Kickstarter for its upcoming decentralized product ( to date , Kickstarter has successfully supported over 214,000 projects with over $ 6B in funding and 20M backers ) which will attract new users to the ecosystem The Celo Reserve includes almost $ 1M of MCO2 tokens , and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the Climate Collective ."
Below I have also attached a collage with some of the headlines from our database without a specific order/preference to show you how diverse the sentiment and coverage is .
"More extensive simulation might shed light on the precise amount of borrowed ZRX or other tokens needed to manipulate the open market price , and as such what total borrowable supply across DeFi is safe ."
"In what affects withdrawals , I have a feeling that incentives/profitability based on basic Aave pool dynamics simply don ’ t matter in a situation like this ."
Saving a couple of YFI for the Treasury is simply not worth while if it risks alienating key contributors in the process .
I ’ m not advocating wrapping MakerDAO in a legal entity   not at all .
"The Phase I team has members from the Nethermind team with probably one of the highest expertise about Starknet and its connection with Ethereum , having working on a Solidity to Cairo transpiler ."
This is what many Bitcoin maximalists hope for BTC .
"Considering the DAI USDC 0.05 percent pool on Polygon is over 3x more capital efficient than the same pool on Ethereum , it would be expected that the 0.01 percent pool would also see better use of capital compared to the Ethereum pool ."
How much WONE was allocated for the rewards of using AAVE now ?
I ’ ve confirmed this is possible with the Snapshot team   we can leverage subspace functionality to create two kinds of polls with two different delegation/self delegation requirements .
Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI .
Deployments of GHO on the Aave Protocol across other chains will require further governance approval .
"This issue may also contribute to the abundance of lower quality proposals , as proper education and dissemination of these ideas is lacking ."
The above statements I made in my prior proposal still hold .
"Bankless DAO ( $ BANK ) Bankless DAO is a decentralized community focused on driving adoption and awareness in bankless money systems like Ethereum , Bitcoin , and DeFi ."
"If enacted , this proposal will activate the first facilitator : the Aave Protocol   specifically the AAVE market on Ethereum ."
"they have around 800k CVX , we could buy it all and still have change left over"
"Si es viable , contá conmigo !"
As I really don ’ t know how “ expensive ” it is those numbers seem high for me .
"Additionally we are building ontop of Uniswap ( unlike Voltz   which forked Uniswap ) , so all of our TVL/usage is strictly additive to Uniswap ( we are in no way taking away from Uniswap ) ."
"However , in v2 of the Keep3r jobs network this has been adjusted to ensure that all active Keepers receive bonus at an expected 20 percent ."

"When eventually Port X Settle ( ) the positions taken on behalf of their users between network A et B , they will settle more than what has been minted by the Aave protocol ."
MakerDAO 3.0   Direct Deposit Module ( D3M ) The direct deposit module is a mechanism by which DAI liquidity is injected directly into external DeFi protocols like Aave .
I ’ d love to here questions or thoughts you have on anything pertaining to the app .
L2 voting is out of scope .
I suppose you and teej have already answered in that you hope the yields will be higher than the minimum .
"Delegate Statement StableLab , under StableNode , is a governance research and product development company ."
"Initially , we propose setting a 50m ceiling to test ."
"Regulatory thinking at MakerDAO is driven almost purely by news headlines , and the recent drama on discord around Tornado Cash sanctions is just an example ."
We will also specialize in making onboarding content for each core unit .
"This post is a proposal for a mechanism we think would help Uniswap allocate , in size , towards that ."
"As a direct participant in the loans themselves , the DST would have pari passu perfected security interests in all collateral pertaining to those specific loans ( collateral secured by a recorded mortgage and/or UCC or other appropriate security documentation ) and in no way be subordinated to the Bank ’ s interests ."
It is unfair to expect the community and delegates to independently make this sort of review and assessment at the final vote when considering whether or not to accept a lending business .
Where does exchange for the asset occur ?
Act to minimize the DAO ’ s exposure to assets that have changing risk profiles due to idiosyncratic risk events Eg : Freeze FEI reserve before liquidity conditions change .
"Considering that NFTs have historically had strong correlation with ETH , it probably makes sense to price NFTs in ETH and convert to USD , but this decision should account for changing market dynamics and correlations ."
Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset ?
Thank you for the question and the concern .
"Alongside major releases or ongoing risk assessments , we will host regular community calls and office hours for platform feedback and discussion ."
"( Yes i know , Wornhole said they will fill up the ETH so the backing will be again 1:1 , but this isn ’ t always the case ."
Here I guess it will be the London stock exchange .
Thanks for the OP for detailed overview of the topic and everyone who contributed to the discussion .
It is better to err on the side of caution given the fairly low expected returns from borrows against long tail assets vs the enormity of funds in the Aave v2 market .
You get paid automatically .

"To keep the system solvent , the protocol absorbs borrower accounts that violate the collateral requirements ."
"This in turn creates a trade off where : If you want to exit veYFI , you will earn less and less until your lock period expires ."
Actually if a person is up for borrowing USDC or DAI it ’ s hard to find lower rates to borrow than at Compound .

Background Block Analitica is the core entity behind MakerDAO ’ s risk team .
"More generally , I think Aave Companies should publish a proposal like Gauntlet and Llama detailing a scope of work , timeline and KPIs ."
That scenario is generic enough to run for all instances on all chains .

"Users who are planning to share wealth face a dilemma   Lock their positions into a cold wallet that will allow a handoff to succession key holders , or continue to actively manage their positions to maximize yield , but risk loss of those assets at the time of handoff ."
This is why Switzerland was chosen as a base jurisdiction for the issuer and that ’ s also why tremendous time and resources were spent on filing an EU prospectus .
"The entity should also give the UF the ability to enter into contracts , open a bank account , and hire employees ."
Entrusting large sums of revenue to governance without any checks in place on how these funds will be used is extremely dangerous !

"In practice there are 2 aspects to consider : Even if there is some history of participation of these parties in governance votes , in practice it is way less probable having them do any type of adversarial action than all the rest of the holders , as in the big majority of the cases , they are highly regulated ."
Reserves are a function of interest rates and total amount borrowed .
"Ie , if this proposal passes , people can lock veyfi for no reward , but then vote for reward ?"
"The CRV scenario we saw yesterday is primarily due to USDC ’ s very permissive LTV ( 87 percent )   so if we want to take broad measures to risk off the Aave Protocol , I ’ d start by lowering USDC LTV ."

If you need to dial in via phone just say so at the beginning !
"V3 has also seen demand for stable Efficiency Mode ( eMode ) , with proposals for new asset listings such as this one for FRAX continually taking advantage of Aave V3 ’ s capital efficiency ."
FST does not currently have a yield but the team is open minded and I can easily see the framework for an updated token model that creates a yield and aligns incentives .
They may still voice either support or opposition to the CIP ’ s claims of improving Compound but that should not factor into their descion making criteria to approve a CIP .
The treasury currently has $ 18.1m of cash assets remaining .
Being available to answer questions on governance related matters .
The in depth discussion is brilliant and every question valid .
So one way to address this is via smart contract allowlisting ( similar to Curve ) .

"The thing is , it ’ s something I ’ ve also thought about since I first learned about Maker ; the level of innovation , creativity , proposals , and solutions being developed here are really impressive ; I think a lot of people would be attracted to Maker simply because they would want to know how we ’ re making it all work ."
BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey .
The DAO should have a global budget that is approved by MKR holders and all CUs should need to fit their expenses into this global budget .
it ’ s actually oracle issue rather than a bridge itself .
Proposed language to be added to v3 core license grants.uniswap.eth if the proposal is successful : Voltz Labs Technology Limited ( “ Voltz ” ) is granted an additional use grant to allow the Voltz DAO to use the Uniswap V3 Core software code ( which is made available to Voltz subject to license available at https : //github.com/Uniswap/v3 core/blob/main/LICENSE ( the “ Uniswap Code ” ) ) .
Do you see replication of each of the tech functions within each MetaDAO or more a framework of “ satellite MetaDAOs ” that bridge across several purpose focused SubDAOs ( e.g .
I hope those who voted for it fully understand what they voted for .
"For example , Aave v1 still has over $ 20 million in stablecoin deposits held within various OG iearn finance curve pools ."
"People who are deeply integrated into it , like say Core Unit members , or large long term holders of MKR , will naturally have a greater faith in the protocol ."
"The announced protocol only has one borrowable asset , such as USDC , and thus one interest rate curve ."
"This is something that will evolve over time , so it doesn ’ t mean we have to completely figure this out before changing the existing program ."
"At MakerDAO , we have successfully pushed forward a Dai Direct Deposit Module for Compound that will conservatively bring a 100 million DAI credit line to the protocol ."
BanklessDAO can then accept this offer in full or in part .

Hi and thank you @ cylon for your feedback .
"Do you foresee a certain exposure limit to avoid moving away from our over collaterized stance , if so , what is the limit ?"
What was the tangible impact of previous grants program ?
I can ’ t say for sure exactly how much is still unallocated either but I ’ m quoting directly from the docs and doing some math and there ’ s nothing about 100 percent of the remaining community fund being allocated to exiting LP rewards .
Track the price relative to $ 1 on various platforms and price impact versus trade size .
"Gauntlet celebrates the passing of the “ Gauntlet < > Compound Renewal ” proposal , breaks down the voting , and reminds us of their new “ insolvency refund. ” “ Contributors need to be accountable to the DAOs they serve. ” In Discord Reaching quorum has been a challenge lately ."
"Thus , we want to engage the said community in each proposal , from simulation creation to testing review to proposed change enforcement ."
I believe this is something the DAO is missing with the handful of RWA loans that have been deployed .
"Disclaimer : I ’ m not experienced in risk topics at all , but this feels rushed ."
Hi @ bgdlabs   we welcome this early discussion .
"I think this bear market generated some junctures , such as the collapse of several stables , that helped Maker position itself even better with the public eye ; people know that DAI implies confidence ."
This response time could have been reduced with more preparation .
"I believe on tg you endorsed using profits , and not lowering the cr , though I can ’ t find it at the moment ."

Participation Terms : MakerDAO ’ s security interest in the loan documents and associated collateral would be apportioned through a Master Purchase Agreement ( and Portfolio Purchase Agreement ( s ) ) or a Master Credit Agreement vis a vis the MBPTrust .
The value of zero estimates the protocol state when all COMP rewards are off .
I ’ m supportive of a renewed proposal but caution against liking them to the “ master. ” It is my belief that Aave is better off with two Risk Managers and Gauntlet as one of them ; it encourages competition and forces both to be the best versions of themselves .
We expect the full deployment will take 2 3 weeks .
"30 percent ( 8,533 COMP ) will be paid in lump sum fund transfer ."

But we need to be actively monitoring these things as they ’ re happening .
Updated guides and documentation for proposers—Wormhole will curate and actively maintain docs around the added cross chain governance proposal features and interface .
"Decentralization is important , but not in every aspect of the protocol ."
Thanks for the question .
"Keep in mind that for legal reasons , residents of certain jurisdictions are geoblocked from accessing the dex ."
"Secondly , with a diversified pool providing upside to “ a lot of ” application level assets , it may be the case that the provided upside is too much of a financial incentive in the long run ; the parallel drawn to the financial motives being higher to contribute in an application layer project is countered by the fact that it is objectively not possible to join/contribute to , say , 10 projects at the same time : one has to choose at most 1 2 desirable projects ."
I ’ m very supportive of this proposal and can ’ t wait to use the tools to come .
"As @ monet supply mentioned , this gives the opportunity to LPs that want to avoid protocol fee pools to re deploy liquidity to the most active pool for their preferred tokens ."

These resources will ensure that we are always making the progress necessary on our development roadmap to support priorities as they grow and change .
This has already been talked about on TG around how to handle UST risks in the 4pool .
We are certainly open to adjusting the distribution of AAVE vs. stablecoins in the funding of the engagement based on community feedback .

The community must understand that this implementation is merely a 120 day test on a select few pools with the lowest percent fee collection possible .
"Step two is to elevate the roles of delegates and recognize they serve a purpose as critical as Facilitators , by matching the compensation of top Facilitators for the top group of delegates that are designated as “ Executive Delegates ” , giving them a generous MKR bonus as well as “ soft job security ” , meaning they can ’ t just lose their compensation from one day to another ."

"I also tend to think ability to borrow protocol minted DAI against MKR is a very weak incentive to hold MKR ( even if we charge 0 percent , there is little excess value vs just using Compound or Aave ) ."
"rAAVEs in particular have been an important pillar and brand strength for driving Aave ’ s community , Additionally , events are a way for us to increase our reach by partnering with other relevant protocols for cross promotion to their communities ."

"so that they can create agents , scenarios , simulations , and interact with the simulation engine via all available methods ( hosted interface , CI , API , etc . ) ."
"Gauntlet has been very active in monitoring changes during these volatile times , and has proactively pushed through amendments / param changes to coordinate efforts across large groups of stakeholders to keep the protocol safe ."
For example we ’ re not going to invest time or money into integrating something if it ’ s ultimately not going to be used .
This sets up the same workflows defined in the official Comet repository at the commit in which we forked .
"It would , of course , be absolutely amazing for there to be free , open , easy to use software for one to measure risk on their own and be able to validate that the conclusions are correct ."
"From this year onward , the token will be used for two main purposes : RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin ( RToken ) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return , may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens ."
"WOO DEX is a DEX built on NEAR that looks and feels like a centralized exchange but operates on chain and will provide spot and margin trading , perpetual swaps and lending and borrowing ."
"All this to say that if we want DAI to become decentralized money then I think : Decentralized money needs a fast , low cost , and sufficiently decentralized ledger so that there is 100 percent uptime ; Decentralized money needs decentralized and uncorrelated demand ; and Such demand needs to be sufficient such that you ’ re too big to fail and very unlikely to see a large enough liquidity collapse that would erode trust There are concrete steps to ensure point 1 is addressed ."
I frequently see people express thinking along the lines of “ there ’ s no way price can go up if we aren ’ t burning ” or “ why would I hold MKR if burns aren ’ t happening ” .
"For this robust plan with three focus areas , I recommend prioritizing L2s because that ’ s the lowest hanging fruit for quickly invigorating growth ."
STAX governance will be a further iteration of the TempleDAO representative governance model .
"Today it lies fallow , an asset liability mismatch that exposes the protocol to myriad risks ( interest rate , duration , liquidity , etc ) that will accrue value to the protocol ."
"From the proposal , emphasis mine : 0xJiji : In other words , buying out strategists from the 10 percent performance fee arrangements is likely to result in YFI in the range of ~ $ 5 25m to be locked into veYFI ."
Thanks for taking initiative on this !

"Speculation on fields to cover ( GHO , community contribution , etc ) , without really understanding what the community requires at the moment ."
Below is a simplified view of the trade offs from the protocol ’ s and contributor ’ s point of view .
I watch with intrigue as all the defi applications continue to develop and grow .
"Since pivoting to web3 , Trilez has : Added a LINK market Added support for splitting COMP rewards between suppliers and borrowers and promptly fixed the newly introduced proposal 62 bug Performed a temperature check for retroactive COMP token distribution to early users Added a USDP market Added a FEI market Prepared a RAI market listing proposal Been working with Getty & GFX Labs to introduce various other assets including stETH and RAI Been working to create a market listing framework ; the template for which has been used in the RAI proposal Started working on a multi chain evaluation framework and has started writing automated deployment and configuration scripts Created Pythia   a decentralized , fully on chain price and liquidity oracle providing manipulation resistant price feeds ( still a work in progress ) , built with Compound in mind The intention of v1 is to be used with Compound ’ s L2 deployments since it ’ s too costly in gas to be used on mainnet A v2 has been roughly planned out to consume much less gas with some trade offs Services offered The following services offered are exclusively in relation to COMP rewards program ( s ) , in no particular order ."
I support this idea .
why are we not taking advantage of that and making the profit for ourselves ?
"Aligning the incentives of the Maker workforce with MKR holders , as @ rune discussed in depth here ."
"Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser , this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time , and can not be used for any purpose outside of governance ."

"Timeline After passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network , we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on chain vote ."
"The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal , however the UF may also self delegate the UNI to vote , and to put up its own proposals ."
Advisory Our primary advisory focus will be to help shepard the new CIP framework that was recently adopted by the community with the approval of CIP 1 .
The team plans to create programs to attract builders and fund their initiatives to accelerate the adoption of the network .

We ’ re supportive of this proposal .
"Absolutely love this write up , thanks team !"
"V3 also provides the ability to set liquidation collection factors , meaning the DAO can benefit from fee accumulation during liquidation events ."
The corresponding USD denominated line of credit is issued .
"Tracking the status of each grant awarded ( noted above ) was the first step and over the coming months we will work to collect , aggregate and share more metrics around the activity generated with the community ."

This is great !
Nomad can provide an out of the box solution for this problem .
Not sure community will get much additional benefit from this expenditure ?
Fully agree with this .
"the onboarding rETH as collateral , it seems MakerDAO viability is predicated upon serving whales/bulge bracket/large positions almost exclusively ."
"There are functional L2s on ETH available today , and several are still in development ."
"Regarding setting precedents , we should actually be less cautious about proposals becoming as precedents to follow and leave room for the community to explore various options and alternatives regarding how to fund proposals and based on the outcomes understand more what works for the Aave community and bring the best results ."
Won ’ t this destroy MakerDAO contributors retention ?

"While WBTC has already migrated , the other markets have not ."
We are in contact with these users ( to the best of our ability to contact them ) to ensure that they are aware of the risks posed here and that they are actively managing their positions to avoid liquidation .
"It is important to also highlight and clarify some aspects of the situation : The underlying assets deposited into Aave V3 Harmony are the main part affected by the exploit , and on that , the Aave protocol has no role and/or solution , as the impermanent/permanent loss would be on the depositors holding the bridged underlying and depositing it on Aave ."

"For example , the Aave DAO could gain a new source of revenue whilst becoming part of the governance of Balancer , a closely aligned protocol ."
Happy to help .
Response : The CEO and President of the Bank are both informed and involved in the process however their explicit approval is not required for the Bank to enter into a participation agreement as these authorities are granted to the executive officers in the ordinary course of business .

Plain vanilla only .
"With the transition to V3 where capped supply and borrow are possible , I think most would agree that publicly deciding the risk budget would be best ."
The fee saving is less extreme for USDC ETH swaps .
"You need to look no further than Gauntlet ’ s outline for v3 support , in which it references the “ several months ” it has spent to expand risk modeling to support v3 ."
"This is expected to include an adjustment to interest rate model reducing rates across the utilization curve , as well as an increase in the cETH borrow cap ( or full removal of borrow cap depending on community preferences ) ."
"In order to do this , we need to commit our code and push it to GitHub ."
The public prospectus denotes the considerations of such upgradability and possible future functions that might be added .

"D3M value generation through adopted vaults A key long term value proposition of all CreatorDAOs is that they will run their own “ mini versions ” of the Maker Vault Engine that will act as a lending engine for the MetaDAOs , and will be specifically optimized for Maker to tap into through a D3M construct ."
It also allows LPs to produce CSV data of positions and swap/add liquidity for a position as well .
"Anecdotally I ’ ve spoken to three people that bid , but didn ’ t win any auctions ."
That would produce the same outcome .
"Developer experience is analogous to UX for software developers , particularly UX in professional tools that are essential for abstract tasks and have direct impacts on productivity , effectiveness , happiness , frustration , and therefore cost ."
"To outline our thinking behind this addition , we split lending parameter optimization into a two step process : Balancing losses due to insolvency with capital efficiency Balancing the tradeoff between increasing supplier APY and growing reserves to cover insolvency losses In the first stage of our modeling , we focused on optimizing capital efficiency within the community ’ s acceptable risk tolerance ."

this is @ Traster_Tray this is super useful
Then take into account additional analysis/frameworks + learnings from Phase 1 for Phase 2 .
The risk reward ratio is in my opinion on the side of deploying compound there .
"eboado : During that period , and just until really recently , no support was given to important v2 pools like Avalanche and Polygon You ’ re absolutely right here   this was due to resource constraints and poor expectation setting ."
This creates a long runway for RWA LendCos to lure the best and brightest from boring 9 to 5 jobs to the frontier of financial innovation in MakerDAO .
It seems like this was a big part of the original content plan for the @ makerDAO account but it fell quite flat on the metrics you ’ ve highlighted .
Will be worth monitoring .
The core mechanism shouldn ’ t change too much but its constituents may change as DAI strategically allies with other stables .

There ’ s no other reasons .
"We believe to be in the mandate of RWF to exercise judgement on how to engage with all counterparties that want to onboard on Maker , also considering that each counterparty maintains free access to forum and governance ."
A key piece of this will be understanding the concentration risks and building structural diversity into the term sheet/purchase agreements .

"Implementation So , what is the minimum viable way to do these things ?"
I do not believe that the community has been given sufficient time to grasp the change and contribute to the conversation .
"Maker is one of the most decentralised projects in crypto , but has essentially been punished for that   it ’ s much easier for de facto centralised competitors to roll out a cohesive brand and marketing approach ."

Upwards and onwards !
"CreatorDAOs in particular can also begin to innovate and experiment in directions that are less directly tied to the Maker Core , unleashing the power of autonomous and innovate communities ."
This model seems to ignore this effect and the volatility ( or any higher order moments of the price process ) .

"If we consider implementing ERC4626 vaults and specifically Aura ’ s BPTs , there is a notable increase in yield ( “ Aura Boost ” ) for potential collateral types : Note : Aura Boost is calculated as the increase in yield from utilizing Aura as opposed to the lower bound of native BPTs ."
Very open to ideas on what else we can do here .

"Therefore it may make sense to formalize these contributions in a consistent way , ensuring that demand from new users is met ."
Great question .
This version of Dai is a principle connection between on chain capital markets and the global money market .
I ’ m glad to see concrete direction for RWA and looking forward to see how this iterates and then working on implementing these guidelines .

"@ pauljlei , on behalf of Gauntlet , recommends “ no changes to Compound II ’ s current parameterization ” for the week ."
How it works : Users will deposit ERC20 into Aztec and initiate the Compound deposit or borrow request via zk.money .
"So , the first group in my opinion carries no risk , and the second , if we assume a bit of rationality of the majority ( not trying to risk capital to probably get nothing ) , is marginal → no action ."
I can confirm Shreyas doesn ’ t review grants and has no hand in pushing Llama related grants .
Details on how the contract interfaces and message protocol could look like can be seen here .
"You have the right to your feelings , but this does not necessarily make your claims true ."
"Should the community be satisfied with the performance of the initial vault , the opportunity exists to scale up exposure to HVB accordingly ."
"With that being said , GFX Labs has done an excellent job in outlining the TLC the protocol needs ."
"Some people think Convex locking up more FXS is a bad thing ; I own a lot of CVX , so I ’ m okay with it because I win on both FXS and CVX side ."

"As more listing comes on chain , the demand for FRAX would also increase and hence help to create a sustainable source of alternative income for the protocol ."
It uses a “ Time Weighted Average Price ( TWAP ) of both sales and floor prices to create a blended price that will be used to value floor punks. ” This is actually an intelligent approach because it filters out outliers and wash sales to provide a reliable floor price that ’ s resistant to manipulation .
This project will bring great liquidity and be beneficial to both !
Why can democracies compete with dictatorships ?
"Finally , we have the third approach   finding the equilibrium where profits are maximized ."
It will be one more tool in the toolset .
I also want to echo what @ jkim mentioned around “ recalling the assets before X time period ” .
"Changing the borrow cap from 90,750 to 150,000 COMP and switching the rate model to the one used by cUNI , as this proposal suggests , should help the market attain “ a more suitable equilibrium. ” The proposal passed with nearly 100 percent voting “ for ” and is now queued for execution ."
We look forward to those discussions .
Benefits : encourages migration to both the Comet USDC and wETH markets .
"If the “ Aggressive Growth Strategy ” is ratified , I see these initiatives as moving in parallel ."

I know bridges are shutdown atm and Fraxswap can be used to bring more FRAX onto Arbitrum but are we being a bit aggressive in thinking getting those high of levels is appropriate .
The LP token staBAL3 BTC is to be held in the Aave V2 RF and the expected yield is around 4.60 percent vAPY .
Selling 3.6m FXS could materially impact FXS price since most of the liquidity would be gone .
"With one week to go until the suggested next proposal submission date ( October 10 ) , wanted to check in and see if there are any obstacles , and also confirm who will be submitting the proposal ."
"For MKR holders the Singularity Engine allows you to lock up your tokens and then get basically every benefit that it ’ s possible to provide a token holder , including multiple types of yield and the ability to generate Dai ."
The design space around how a fee switch can be used is much larger and it ’ s crucially important to all of DeFi that we consider the design space broadly .
Every migrator can sell the xLP token in the Curve pool and gets unlocked LP tokens in return .

"The approach I ’ d recommend would be to separate the oracle gas expenses as a separate line item with a different calculation ( since the initial transfer covered Aug Dec ’ 21 and Q1 2022 , plus an emergency fund , you I ’ d base the calc off the ex emergency cash flows ) ."
We also have a great deal of experience in helping protocols that integrate stAssets manage supply and borrow demand .
"The reasoning is rather simple , if we do an on market purchase there is a risk market participants will know when the AIP will execute , will see the transaction and will be able to sandwich the trade ."
Conclusion Celo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3 .
"If within 1 month of proposal execution the amount of FEI borrows outstanding is still large , the community could consider further changes such as interest rate model change ( increasing borrowing rates ) to ensure all cFEI users are able to withdraw funds and participate in the TribeDAO organized redemption process promptly ."
Work done by Llama is of the highest quality .
It is a matter of finding a balance .
it might not be profitable .
Excess of Treasury earnings is spent on YFI buybacks as per BABY .
but i see no reason why this cant be changed and just use FRAX and not bother with arUSD in the first place .
"Further , LayerZero Labs has demonstrated rigor in designing and parameterizing the highest standard of security required to protect the Uniswap governance process ."
"I think this could help mitigate risks to the Compound protocol and wider defi ecosystem , without negatively impacting protocol usage and financial KPIs ."
So much that our TVL and Yearn community grew and evolved .
The KPI based bonus is paid at the end of our 12 month contract based on the accomplishment of deliverables listed in our proposal .
"For example , SAI , FEI , and REP reserves could be converted into USDC reserves , and WBTC migrated to the newer WBTC market reserves ."
"The multisig is a ⅗ required signatures controlled by a part of the team but also by other people : C2tP   Convex Finance Winthorpe   Convex Finance Charlie   Curve Finance Tommy   Votium Sam   Frax Finance The multisig does not have direct access to user deposit but he can perform different functions : Update a range of parameters such as stash factory , pool manager , change platform fees which enables things like third party incentives to be distributed and incorporating new types of Curve pools ."

Chaos is fully aligned with @ bgdlabs and is excited to see this come to fruition .
"Yes , it could create some asymmetry with other protocols keeping it enabled , but let ’ s be honest , those protocols are doing something really irresponsible given the realistic potential risk of full utilization of ETH , and not having collateral available for liquidation ."

They are also the exclusive distribution and marketing agent for Grayscale Investments .
"If Dai loses market share in decentralized collateral ( for example , Aave outcompetes us on providing leverage ) , then we will be forced to scale down the protocol instead of pivoting to RWAs ."
We also noticed this with the UST USDC pairs with the recent de pegging event where UST ’ s Uniswap v3 price was at about $ 0.91 for a number of days while it was actually trading at a small fraction of that .
"Eventually , Compound III could have a major footprint across blockchains & assets–but first , the protocol should be tested in a production environment at limited scale ."

The opportunity cost of not expanding rapidly and in size into other chains might cost Maker its leadership position .
A “ Port ” is thus an Aave V3 Portals integration by a third party app allowing cross chain asset “ teleportation ” on 2 or more networks .
"If you are selling hybrid bonds at 10 percent , and this is considered very low cost of capital vs cost of MKR tokens ( Cost of Equity ) , why would I not rather buy MKR tokens because ( a ) in the absence of stress , MKR should gain ( b ) if there is stress , I ’ m not protected being a debt holder ( vs the traditional banks which benefit from guarantees ) The $ 400m investment in Circle is equity investment , I believe , not debt ."
But most of its complexity is abstracted away from end users .
This could be the main fee of fixed forex .

"With that being said , let ’ s get into the value that this proposal will bring ."
The way we see it is two fold : If we made a proposal requesting a financial grant If we forked the code and redployed UNI v3 Then it would make total sense for us to set aside some equity/tokens to the Uniswap foundation .
"With that said , in its current size , it is far from where it needs to be to absorb risk at the moment when Maker increases its exposure to various risks across protocols , different chains and RWAs ."

"No doubt , an increase in revenues and an increase in fees to vKP3R would help secure these goals , but could be greatly enhanced through more direct focus on promoting benefits to users As demonstrated above , fees from Fixed Forex will require far greater levels of demand to achieve a TVL sufficient to generate fees that exceed historical contributions from OLM ."
"Being an exceptional measure , the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves , such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150 percent , until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers ."
"TechCrunch US Treasury sanctions Tornado Cash , accused of laundering stolen crypto – ... U.S. accuses the crypto mixing service of allowing North Korean hackers to launder millions of stolen funds ."
We will be happy to consult !
This is a big part of the reason why the Llama proposal does not rely on utilizing the veBAL holding .
"For example , if HVB is originating a 5 year fixed commercial mortgage , the interest rate will , at a minimum , be 3.50 percent + .30 percent = 3.80 percent ."
"This means they take more risk , but also get higher rewards in the form of more MetaDAO tokens and more direct exposure to the result of their own work ."
This has become increasingly evident in the spate of recent cross chain bridge exploits .
The proposal does not create any expectation the retained tokens will be paid out to UNI token holders .
"Awesome , this is actually a pre listing request , it is the template of Aave Request for Comments in the onboarding of new assets that precedes the Snapshot vote and on chain proposal ."
"1/10 = 10 percent , as suggested by the proposal , is probably a good choice ."
A community is much more well equipped to discuss what assumptions the protocol should make about the current environment vs. debating the nitty gritty between a 88 percent or 91 percent LTV ( based on toolset alone ) .
"There was a moment that was edited out , where I can tell your knowledge of the inner workings of the Maker ’ s core component ( Vat ) is lacking ."
"* edit : for clarity , the $ 1M pool depth would be our deepest stable coin pool , as compared to USDC ( $ 577K depth ) , USDT ( 232k depth ) , UST ( 177k ) ."
The cost of supporting liquidity to the decentralized ecosystem is seen in the necessity for a high degree of stabilizing capital controls .

"A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken , it will typically ( percent determined by governance ) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken ’ s collateral ."
"The rationale is that once borrowing of everything has been stopped , new deposits can ’ t be arbitraged by borrowing , but keeping the “ door ” open for the refilling of collateral or any protocol wide intervention via deposit/injection of liquidity can be important ."
"Then , if someone chooses to disregard this community standard , we can partially or fully burn their stake through the disaster recovery / migration mechanism outlined above ( lock all stkMKR , issue new token with deposit based migration for unstaked MKR and merkle claim for staked MKR , and partially or fully remove offending tokens from merkle claim ) ."

"Key features offered by using Alpha Vaults include higher yields , automatic rebalancing , automated fee collection , and gas fee savings ."
Is it though ?
We note that we take integrations ( and the statistical reliability of our simulations — which are 7 orders of magnitude per day more than what OP seems comfortable using to manage billions of dollars ) seriously and make sure that our model quality is up to the highest standards before we support a new version of a protocol .

Porter_Smith : The Core Unit structure is arguably already legally decentralized ; many are individually wrapped in their own LLC and none are directed by the managerial efforts of others .
I also echo the thought of creating and listing Balancer Boosted pools e.g .
"The yield available for farmers will be impacted by two major factors ; What level of votes are used to vote for each gauge , as this determines what share of newly issued CRV will be emitted to the pool What total value is locked ( TVL ) in the pool , as yields scale downwards with increase in TVL ."
Actions executed Stop of borrowing on all assets of the pool .
"By employing similar first principles model frameworks used in fractional reserve banking according to Basel III and other regulatory frameworks , Frax could also be the leader and ahead of any competition if there is eventually a regulatory crackdown on stable coins ."

Could we use these WONE to compensate part of the lost ONE while disabling the reward ?
Risk management evolves quickly .
What matters is the underlying and the security of the whole conduit .
I also think the treatment of the issuance of the DAOs ( various Tokens they issue ) vs. the DAOs themselves creates a greater surface area for regulatory litigation .
"A few important points remain open in my opinion   first of all , we will need to attract liquidity in the new market   the community will likely need to come around with a short term , well targeted liquidity mining program for v3 ."

2 > But even more exciting for investors who want a small stake in a simple NFT is that it works with FRAX through that investment .
To me this should be broken down into two separate proposals : If bridged assets and multi chain assets truly are a threat then they should be removed .
We have a lot of experience doing so via our FLI Flexible Leverage Index product range on mainnet and Polygon .
Risk can probably provide specific updated scenario analysis for those “ accepted ” systemic risks .
"The trading price of MKR should incorporate the risk that it will be diluted during stressful times , so the less likely that is to happen ( more surplus ) , the less it should be depressed ."
"Second , the web3 ecosystem is rapidly growing , with many more coins being introduced ."
Why are we the best to do this ?
We have one of the longest on chain track records for providing risk recommendations to protocols throughout DeFi .
"And therefor , proactively , can have a more informed discussion on whether or not the current set of assumptions should change ."
Note this is only 94.4 percent of the assets and 5.6 percent of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF .

"Step four is to also include external consultants and experts in order to validate and challenge the internal perspectives in the community , to avoid an echo chamber situation ."
"In addition , owning $ CVX not only allows one to have voting power over Curve ’ s governance but also over other governance bodies such as Frax Finance where Convex already owns 2.5 percent of the protocol ’ s voting power ."
so that means there will be future FXS emissions allocated to that pool as well via this deal .
Spidomo : The number of participants would probably increase dramatically if we achieved integration with major DEX aggregators ( e.g .
A few interesting observations ( to me ) are : We have a lot more coverage in Asia than we expected   Eg .

"Our Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerant ( FBFT ) consensus protocol , combined with random state sharding and Boneh–Lynn–Shacham ( BLS ) constant sized signatures allows Harmony to achieve finality in one block or roughly two seconds – compared to optimistic finality in Solana or Avalanche , or 6 seconds for Cosmos , or 60 seconds for Polkadot ."
It may be worth revising the rate models after gaining some empirical data from early market operations .
This would also be accessible by the whole community and would be used by OpenZeppelin auditors if we ever do more asset listing audits .
"Utilizing rewards can be a very effective way to grow Compound , but the way we go about it is key ."
"Second to that , is such a benchmarking scalable across different MetaDAOs ?"
"The grants should help new projects , individuals ."
This has very powerful network effects to make 1 FRAX token the default stablecoin rather than multiple kinds of bridged FRAX each with low liquidity and use cases .
I know some folks might have “ sticker shock ” at the pricing but remember that DAOs don ’ t run magically…they need real people doing real work…executing at a high level .
"To incentivize the utilization of FRAX as collateral , we propose the creation and funding of an unbalanced ( no slippage or impermanent loss ) FRAX/arUSD pool based on Arable ’ s swap contract ."
This mechanism encourages continued governance engagement from delegators and may make owners more willing to delegate votes ( as they retain greater sovereignty over their voting power if needed ) .

"In order to achieve this we must first undo or lower the exposure of USDC , we can not dictate “ we are a decentralized entity ” when we are the largest holders of USDC , the mentality must change if we want full decentralization , make the contracts for RWA tiny , not look for large companies ( even if something bad happens the impact is not so serious ) and we can not dictate decentralization when we are happy with associations like BlackRock , we must follow the legacy of privacy and freedom , or at least camouflage centralization with decentralization rune : we can recapture that original spirit and once again prove to be the vanguard of the entire crypto spirit as we once where when we pioneered actually functional on chain stablecoins and created DeFi , it will create a completely new level of attention and positive meta around the Maker ecosystem as a whole , which will result in an influx of users , community members , contributors Totally agree , but the adventures of End Game are very abrupt , difficult to understand for new users , if we want to be what it was before we need support , the decentralization mentality has to be totally real , and always meticulous with the plays and the cards that are used , because it is useless , to dictate and not follow the example , RWA and End Game can coexist RWA as you say , to a lesser extent , of course , but the greatest operation that will exist in cryptography is the union between the real world and crypto , we must find to be that bridge that a person will want to have without KYC and without any kind of danger ."

I don ’ t think either of the two steps help to make the treasury a safer reserve : Replacing UNI tokens by “ other protocol ” tokens doesn ’ t necessarily make the treasury any less volatile .
"As we wait , the people that borrowed the assets have less reason to pay back early because the longer they hold the higher the de peg risk goes , and if it de pegs it makes it much cheaper for them to pay back the loan ?"

Cross linking to this update post re : deployment .
@ TokenBrice yours as well   acting as a large delegate across a myriad of DeFi protocols .
"For example , the bug would be detected by the following rule : Rule : maxCompReward Description : The max COMP reward of a user has an upper limit , based on the current supplyState , borrowState and compAccured ."
It is our belief that $ UNI holders should think about the goals of the protocol in this order : Growth   Driving Protocol Volume Liquidity   Maintaining / Deepening Protocol TVL Ecosystem Sustainability   Generating Fees Given the early stage of the protocol ( and DEX trading generally ) fee generation should only be implemented if it doesn ’ t materially disrupt volume and liquidity .
"As much as this sounds like an overreaction , we believe that Aave should freeze ETH borrowing in the interim period leading up to the merge ."
"During the process , many people voiced a desire to have more time to research this proposal before voting ."
This is an inaccurate characterization   the asset classes in the Gitbook are examples of assets that these portfolios could be exposed to and do not indicate that we are covering them now or in the future .
I think that their voting mechanism is not very objective concerning the team ’ s effort .
"Giving LPs additional utility like depositing as collateral has been on our radar for some time , so it would be great to see an actual solution in place ."
For private credit it would usually be at least 20 percent .
"Gauntlet definitely spends a lot of time researching and working with zero knowledge researchers ( having written two papers on ZK DeFi and cohosting the ZK Podcast ) to try to make this a reality and when it is technically feasible , we are excited to provide it to the community ."
"One thing I think you should change would be paying for interest in FXS on the user side , it would make more sense to pay the interest in whatever the supplied collateral is and have the protocol buy FXS on the open market with it ."
"To give DAI stable end user demand , Maker needs to go to where the users are , and the users are drifting to Layer 2s and multi chain ."
This ROI is among the highest rates across DEXes throughout all cryptocurrencies .

"Yes , new tokenomics are being discussed as we speak , though liquidity mining may continue in the near future if the community decides so ."
"Having said that , here is our dashboard with the findings : https : //www.certora.com/erc20s/aave listings/ In summary , the stMATIC token code complies with our generic mintable ERC20 specification ."
"Competitive advantage : The Curve 3pool on all L2s and sidechains is still set to the 4bps base fee that it was originally deployed with and although Curve governance can at anytime make changes to the fee structure of these pools , there is no urgency for them to do so since Uniswap ’ s lowest fee tier on these L2s/sidechains is 5bps ."
We lived it with Curve dropping our importance in 3Poool and now Aave with this move .
The model for how full timers at Yearn are compensated was set at the height of the bull market and no longer corresponds with reality .
"Uniswap V3 also employs a block based pricing mechanism   whereby it uses the price at the beginning of the block for the whole amount , making it difficult and prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to adversely move the price without great risk and expense ."
"Moderate industry experience in most areas , adequate depth ."
"During this time , the tokens will contribute to the protocol safety module , helping to reduce risk for the protocol ."
What long term effects are there ?
"The streamlining of compensation and the redistribution of compensation seem to be quite different , and might warrant their own proposals ."
"As a result , it is unclear which groups delegate to which actors , how those actors vote , and what incentives they have ."
"However , there are two downsides to the first approach : a ) Uniswap has less control over the token creation/burning process ( thus harder to create custom logic in the future ) , and b ) It is harder to migrate to a different setup , essentially enhancing the degree of vendor lock in that should already be a parameter in our bridge selection thought process , even without expanded cross chain governance ."
I would be interested to see how different agencies perceived MakerDAO and what their pitch was to increase brand awareness .

We want the teams to keep building by providing revenue share for their hard work .
"Limitations and Tradeoffs : Since we do not have data on borrower elasticity , we can not model borrower behavior ."
"For example , a rule for ETH borrows written by Jared Flatow ( VP Engineering ) from the Compound team found a mismatch in the computation of accrued interest , that prevented users from fully repaying loans ."

"My concern is there may not be appetite , just at the moment , to put such a large amount of FRAX at risk of impermanent loss or exploit without a compelling reason and general prospects of growth are not compelling when we are already have significant liquidity"
"For example Bank of America operates with $ 2 trillion Assets Under Management ( AUM ) , Bank of America can not grow its AUM 100x from here to increase their earnings further ( because they can not allocate $ 200 trillion effectively ) ."
Let me know if these answer your questions !
"But the Aave community should start thinking a bit more about the direction of procedures , if not , decentralized coordination will become a mess down the line ."

"On the issue at hand , which is the process for the procurement of a bridge provider , we agree with Other Internet ’ s proposal that it would be beneficial for a legal agreement to be reached with the bridge team , so as to better guarantee the quality of the outcome , especially when considering the value of the totality of the Uniswap community ."
"Currently , the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges ."
"We believe in the creation of common goods , so all the code created by BGD Labs in relation to specific tasks on Aave will be open and owned by the Aave DAO itself , whenever possible ."
This proposal was communicated and recommended for voting to delegates to prevent any adverse impact to MakerDAO .

"I previously worked with Sam and Travis at Everipedia and would later lead Growth at Gelato , securing some of their first partnerships and integrations as well as played a vital role in the success of their token sale ."
Make it easy and predictable to deal with MakerDAO as a senior secured lender .
"I don ’ t know if it merits a Core Unit unto itself , but a project that I would love to see someone undertake : Establish what the tax ramifications would be of a Sagittarius Engine style profit distribution mechanism , and whether such a mechanism would avoid regulatory risks around being classified as a security ."
"But the integration of the new v3 features for this v2→v3 version will be certainly different from the integration of v2 , and different from the integration of v3 ."

"In addition , by coordinating a regular meeting cadence with the extended Maker community then sourcing and guiding people through your learning paths , we might end up with a faster growing presence than we know what to do with ( with iterations along the way of course , as per SES continuous learning model ) ."
"And I like the approach to setting up one partnership that can be scaled to other institutions and standardize , rather than trying to come up with a “ product ” that any financial institution can tap into without having that first customer ."

"First of all , we intend to refund the gas costs of all 21 voters on Proposal 95 to ensure that our mistakes here don ’ t discourage community participation ."
"We rely on the ability to mint and redeem icETH , which automates the depositing and borrowing of stETH and ETH respectively , to hold the product to Net Asset Value ( NAV ) on secondary markets ."
Our final recommendation is to not adopt a universal bridge solution at this stage .
By increasing the system surplus to the 250m range we can 5x this amount to something more like ~150M per independent loss event .
It ’ s this shrewdness and long term orientation that imbues MakerDAo ’ s brand with cache .
So most probably makes more sense to have that as the second phase of this .
"Development Updates Aave V3 Mainnet Upgrade Originally , the community decided through a temperature check on Snapshot that GHO ’ s first Facilitator would be the Aave V2 Market on Ethereum ; however , in a recent snapshot , the Aave DAO voted in favour of deploying a new Aave V3 Market * on Ethereum ."

"This is highly detailed , and very well written !"
I was one of the persons working on RWAs in the Foundation when the topic first seriously emerged in 2018 .
Purpose This proposal ’ s purpose is to approve the funding of $ 100K FRAX into an unbalanced FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool in partnership with Arable Protocol .
"Seniorage , on the other hand , allows for incentives to be aligned for inclusion , growth and equity decentralization but not for security ."
Liquidity depth for stablecoins are as equally important as having as many trading pairs   and I think this change will help increase FRAX liquidity further .
It ’ s important that whatever we do it is incentivized to stay .
Great proposal and opportunity for Turkish Aave users !
"Or do we use borrow caps ( that have been deliberately built into the Compound system to mitigate risk ) , and have ecosystem partners integrate with Compound as our mechanisms have intended ?"

"Rather than rush to meet an arbitrary deadline , it ’ s more important that we solicit proposals from the best providers and give them a fair chance to compete ."
These could be achieved with the stroke of a pen regardless of the effectiveness of resource allocation .

"Further , this facility would enable HVB to grow new business significantly ."
"Crypto borrowers have grown accustomed to rewards for adoption , which can result in expensive and dilutive emissions ."
I think this really depends on how much of the 100m Frax imagines deploying if the AMO is approved .

This is a win for the Frax community because then it doesn ’ t cost FXS emissions to create permanent Temple Protocol owned FRAX liquidity even if it ’ s technically unlocked .
Collateral owned by the protocol does not work the same as externally owned collateral in a CDP .
On Twitter “ Self custody .
"On the other side , users that are ready to take a larger illiquidity risk but benefit from the current high APY could supply FEI for the little bit of time left , enabling the first class of users to withdraw asap ."
In this way $ FRAX will be safe with growth .
