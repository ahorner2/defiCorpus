From the Centrifuge side we are keen to work with what we view as the fastest growing stablecoin in the ecosystem .
Hopefully this provides a bit more context .
"While there is greater convenience along the transaction supply chain for users in that region , by underwriting Dai to provide a positive return for holders ( and the Access Vault ) , Maker can take some of the marketshare that these digital wallets earn from their customers with stable coins ."

I believe the way the proposed pool is designed it is segregated from the FRAX collateral base and relies on external investors and only discretionary investment from FRAX ’ s owned liquidity ( the FRAX protocol wouldn ’ t mint FRAX directly into this pool nor contribute USDC reserves ) .
Non Ethereum chain metapools are structured differently on Curve ’ s crosschain implementations and thus already automatically earn the base yield of the base pool gauge weight proportionally .
It is important to remind the community that we speak only for ourselves as a passionate and informal group of contributors to this amazing protocol .

Utlilisation has been pretty good ( the snapshot in time below is the lowest I ’ ve seen in the past 36 hours since launch ) .
I.e if solving the counterparty issue through increasing exposure something like sBTC/renBTC were to break some other tenant of the policy then there would be policy pros and cons for the community to weigh and discussion could be had within the context of the ALM .
"Protocol owned liquidity is great , but it need not come from the fees ."
"The zkSync team will submit a snapshot to launch Aave V3 on ZkSync V2 testnet , and thereafter another snapshot for mainnet ( when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met ) ."
Sorry if this wasn ’ t as clear as it could have been .
( 4 ) I will be posting the executed documents over the next day or so .
This is how we should look at rule failures   usually not as bugs but as information about token features .
Our goal is to help Aave navigate this new asset class and assist in creating a strategy for the DAO to access the RWA opportunity while mitigating associated risks .
"To clarify , the focus of this post is about strengthening Maker ’ s resilience to support its Second Growth Engine , i.e ."
And looking forward for this to soon become reality .
"0xJiji : Since it ’ s not being taken , it ’ s also not being replaced… The outcome is unchanged ."
in DAI .
"The simulations they run and their related outputs will be private by default and opened up to the community once related to a public discussion , parameter change , or otherwise related governance vote ."
I have deep knowledge of Aave contracts & good experience in multisigs .
"In the long run , the protocol can still do RWA collateral even if Phoenix Stance , but it has to be “ Physically Resilient RWA ” that is not possible to simply seize through a legal or political order by a global authority ."
"harmony exploit erc201920×723 116 KB ERC20s exploited Given that some of the assets exploited are listed on Aave V3 Harmony ( specifically DAI , USDC , USDT , and AAVE ) , some dynamics of the protocol have been disrupted ."
I am surprised that this is considered and hope that it is not due to personal connections .
"If not disabling deposits , it would be good to have a large warning on the frontend as well to at least help avoid people unknowingly trapping their assets without understanding the situation ."
Why : Create long term deep liquidity on major pools .
I am in support of Celo increasing their supply of nature backed assets held in the Reserve .
"Aave ’ s relationship with users is based on predictability , but maintaining second order characteristics like protocol safety and liquidity could be more important vs specific parameter settings ."
That began my lobbying effort to get people to delegate 100k votes to make it a full fledged proposal .
I ’ d like to nominate @ AndrewA ( Protocol Analyst at Coinbase ) to be a Reviewer .
The Liquidation Incentive parameter then drives the cost of liquidating the collateral and by extension the severity of insolvency loss .
"If a borrower accrues too much interest on their borrow , or the USD value of their collateral reduces too much , or the USD value of their borrow increases too much , the account becomes liquidatable ."
"My personal opinion backed by market data is that synergies are the best self interest strategy for DeFi protocols to increase overall ecosystem stability , liquidity , attractivity , and resilience ."
"Although we can expect in the long term most of the lending rails to move directly on chain , until then Maker will need to accept a higher level of embedded risk that can be only partially mitigated by good structuring and conservative collateralization ."
"If MKR is used as primary DAI collateral ( first line of defense ) , this reduces effectiveness of MKR as a recapitalization resources ( last line of defense ) ."
"That way , as Frax scales , and the RWA allocation of collateral assets scales , the default insurance fund will also scale in tandem ."
LFG !
"Yield bearing , uncorrelated RWAs are being tokenized on chain ."
With more liquidity we should be able to see FRAX ’ s footprint grow incredibly on Optimism as multicollateral rolls out .
There may be some risk here that is present and alluded to by your statement here .
Go on… from lending or other sources ?
"However , in the case the protocol would be successful in raising hundreds of millions in its SS , another question arises as to how to manage dormant money prudently and productively ."
@ Leighton & @ guil lambert can confirm though
"Summary Centrifuge offers investors access to uncorreleated , secured , and reliable loans in an on chain format ."
"An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose , and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain ."
"I also don ’ t personally expect high utilization at all , and while appreciate pointing to it , and accept the case as possible , still don ’ t think as higly probable ."
We hope this will be the start of growing a vibrant and engaging community of grantees that can be a key resource and differentiator for AGD into the future .
"Convex , as DeFi farmers themselves , the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto selling ."
"We appreciate the transparency and believe it is key to the long term development , sustainability , and advancement of Aave ."
"During that quarantine period , every single validator in the SGN and the application executor ( collectively , App Guardians ) can monitor and cross check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain ."
These were used for the 2020 and 2021 1INCH airdrops – some people were just late to collect it .
I like and i support it
"If additional profits will occur , they would accrue in the System Surplus ."
"But , also I ’ ll be Monday Morning Quaterbacking it , just like you and Rune pointed out stuff that the DAO couldn ’ t avoid ( like CU contingency budgeting ) in the early days ."
The rationale should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the CIP .
"In early January , Gauntlet will publish a reserve factor recommendation methodology , which will drive even more impact to the protocol ."
"Voting Updates : Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot   March 14 , 2022 Voted Yes Related Core Value : Pragmatic , Diversity of Ideas and Communities Conflict of Interest : N/A  As the Ambassador program helps to expand access to Maker governance to various communities , which for this one , focuses on Spanish speaking community , I fully support it ."
An internal Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO ) meets monthly to review the Bank ’ s portfolio mix and concentrations – accordingly adjusting or making recommendations as necessary .
It seems eliminating it runs the risk of considerable downside to Yearn .
"In order to incentivize a highly qualified team , the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long term vesting UNI ."
"Would allow the ANGLE team & users ease of access to swap through Synthetix atomic exchanges to other assets Would greatly simplify pool selection/options for holders of ibEUR Would reduce pressure on protocol to maintain peg on multiple ibEUR pools , consolidating focus As per the suggestion for USD pools this could provide some relief to Keep3r as it would no longer be the sole party incentivizing TVL to these pools ( & with deeper TVL it may also create a pathway or self interest for the Synthetix team to incentivize this pool ) References ; See current ibEUR & agEUR curve pools Additional Considerations ; Should be launched alongside peg maintenance strategies , to ensure a balanced pool at launch and the promise of peg being stable post launch May present future opportunities to collaborate with the ANGLE team , including in the spaces of ; Complimentary AMO stratgies Asset listing to lending/borrowing markets Automation of tasks Ramping partners Should also be timed to ensure that any proposed change to the allocation of rKP3R rewards to gauges is harmonious with this change in order to secure maximum potential of TVL growth of the pool Should be paired with a plan to ensure deeper availability and ease of access on Ethereum network of sEUR either through ; Working together to list sEUR on Euler , Aave or Compound ( or perhaps all three ) Working in partnership with Iron Bank to stimulate incentives for sEUR supply & borrow in ETH market Supplementing with an AMO strategy that ensures ongoing supply of sEUR to the newly proposed pool Implementation ; Would likely require new proposals to be made in alignment with the ANGLE team on both the ANGLE forum & through Curve governance ."
"Later at 12:53 AM UTC , Gauntlet canceled Proposal 118 for Risk parameter updates to avoid non critical changes while the fix was pending , with plans to deploy again after the incident was resolved ."
clearly the amount being locked up will slow down now the airdrop is complete .
"The immediately answer from LPs will say “ no ” , since this switch will cut off immediately ."
"There is a ton of research , not to mention our humble experience , that passive LPing on Uni V3 does not work ."
metahayek : USDC I think when we say USDC means assets rather $ FXS
"The question here is , how do we keep track of the actual hours dedicated by such a resource to Compound ?"
This is only partial reason .
We can later move to using EUROC specific price feeds as on chain liquidity improves .
"Of the awarded grants , four are applications and integrations , four are protocol development focused , three are aimed at community ( marketing and educational ) , and one for each of these categories : developer tooling , committees & DAOs that serve Aave ’ s ecosystem and other ."
The Dai generated by the vault should go to market participants depositing tokens into the vault at a slight spread .
"How a user may use DAI , the duration of the loan , is not relevant to the mechanism of the lending ."
Liabilities include $ 466MM in deposits and $ 26.5MM in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank .
"Just like with any product , it may take some time and several iterations for grant projects to develop traction and see adoption ."
"MCO2 and TCO2 ) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests There ’ s a lot to unpack here , given the variable nature and credibility of ‘ nature backed assets ’ now and in the near to mid future ."
$ FUSE also had a massive uptick in token price since launching in the first week of January .
The snapshot vote finishes just after this time so we will be able to use Gauntlet ’ s risk parameters in the asset listing .
Compound still hasn ’ t improved much on this .
The grant focuses on the Financial Action Task Force ’ s ( FATF ) updated guidance for Virtual Assets ( VA ) and Virtual Asset Service Providers ( VASP ) published in October 2021 .
And the Borrowers side is actually the ones who actually create a profits .
Compound III USDC was launched ~one month ago .

"The borrowing limit for UNI is currently $ 49,345,384.00 ."
Wormhole Wormhole is a multisig bridge with 19 guardians ( signers ) .
There are a few possible approaches to evaluating and relaying price data to meet these needs .
"As a quick refresher here : as part of Phase 0 of the Optimism Governance Fund , Uniswap received 1M $ OP tokens to incentivize future growth within the Optimism ecosystem ."
"Below are some areas AGD has fallen short in the past , how we have decided to tackle them and other plans we have for improvement ."
"I fully agree with you , 2M $ is a conservative amount , and Aave definitely needs more than that ."
"Trust minimized Governance : Per Uniswap ’ s goal of becoming a multi chain protocol while remaining trust minimized , we propose using Nomad ’ s trust minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam ."
Should the “ fee switch ” be turned on ?
"Through this proposal , we plan to create a responsible entity on changing the paradigm of $ UNI being represented as purely a redundant “ governance based ” token ."
"However , our reputation has been fading over time , leaving room for the competition to take more space in the various media channels and leaving very limited visibility for MakerDao , although it is the oldest DAO in the whole crypto industry ."
Our engine was designed from the ground up to allow for this type of flexibility .
Simply sharing some context .
Thanks for the additional feedback !
"A concern I have is that it has a lot of moving parts that all have to be moving in tandem , and potentially more rapidly too by introducing volatile collateral like ETH ."
"HVB will originate , into the Trust , loans with both fixed and floating interest rates ."

"So this won ’ t give any power to Yearn , to be part of the future discussions of the project ?"
"The sad truth is that an overwhelming amount of the COMP rewards are being farmed and instantly sold off , making the rewards program ineffective in achieving the initial goal ."
I have to disagree unfortunately .
"Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve ’ s veCRV contract , the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV , then stake to earn CRV , CVX and 3crv , pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders ."

"However , understanding the pain points of developers could help involve them in the governance process , resulting in a platform that is easier to use and has widespread utility across the crypto ecosystem ."
And potentially centralised custody   although we should know more as described by @ monkey.irish .
– Developers believe that forums are cluttered with incomplete proposals that do not benefit the ecosystem .
New Collateral Types Work with Balancer to bring a new type of productive collateral to Aave markets and subsequently roll it out across the various Aave V3 deployments .
Great job putting this together @ cylon .
No top down buyback and market standardisation .
fig : One thing I ’ d like to learn more about   reporting for RWAs .
It ’ s rather from DAOs committed to hold the LP shares long term .
I ’ ll try to schedule time to speak about this on a developer or community call and hear any comments .
"It puts the risk team at a disadvantage where they need to play catch up instead of being at the forefront of analytics , high quality vetted data , and risk management ."

But we need to provide clarity on what it is that we want .
nice to see the voting power is nicely spread out tho .
"In both cases the deployment needs to be approved by the Uniswap DAO , and it is controlled by it in so far as these projects need to request the additional use grant through the governance process ."
"A mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet , Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors , surging to the # 3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $ 500M+ TVL ."
Next Steps A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral .
"0xJiji : The first vesting packages were awarded to long time contributors that contributed Yearn in the very early days , with no expectation of compensation ."
Has the Uniswap Foundation or any other parties provided any analysis on tax or regulatory considerations for this pilot ?
I didn ’ t see anything in snapshot or their forums .
We are open to iterating this amount post the inputs from the community .
A few thoughts :  MKR Minting vs System Surplus : I ’ m not convinced that minting MKR is all that much more capital efficient than a reasonably managed Surplus .
It ’ s okay to invest in growth and I ’ m sure proposals will be approved if they make sense and there ’ s trust that there ’ s actually going to be a return on investment through actual growth .
Quick update regarding UAV v3 .
"If one consensus forms and then it fails , there are 3 others to take over and try alternatives , evolving to a better outcome ."

1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH .
"The Risk Council should be briefed by the risk contributors ( Chaos , Gauntlet ) and other contributors ( BGD , Llama , Aave Companies ) and then based on the information presented execute the option that they as the Risk Council believe is in the best interest of the Aave protocol ( Like @ sakulstra mentioned : `` job is more validating & signing ) ."
"From the basics , Chaos is a strong team and I believe it adds the freedom of choice for more risk tooling to the Aave ecosystem ."
"Summing up   if there is no threat of a depeg right now , it seems to me much more important to think over the debt mechanism than focus on CR=100 percent ."
"However , we are seeing more and more requests for an increase in budget and new Core Unit onboarding applications with large budgets that I fear are overwhelming the Maker community ."
Users earn fees based on utilization of the Uni pair within the ranges defined References/Useful Links ; Uni V3 position leverage overview Live version on Oasis app MakerDAO Forum Application Risk Assessment from MakerDAO Risk Team Keep3r could do this with sXXX pairs in theory however would need to become comfortable with ibXXX then essentially becoming a wrapper for sXXX assets .
Percentage of the borrowing rate “ redirected ” to the Aave collector as fees of the protocol .
We ’ ve been so focused on the terms here that I haven ’ t talked about the Futureswap team much .
Maker is like a Mother who always focus on supporting and stabilizing her kid DAI
Maker also will have no relationships other than a few predictable DAO2DAO relationships with the MetaDAOs and some key protocols such as D3M partners .
"The two most important channels that the DAO currently has are the Twitter handle and the web , from Maker Brand we will start designing all the communications and processes related to Twitter to be able to take over time other intangible assets such as the Web ."
"Otherwise , the additional spending of that figure came from some artist payments and POAP design items ."
I would also say it makes sense to set up some rules for Portals integrations with regards to : minimum time in operation audit & security practices maximum exposure thresholds E.g .
Should Yearn governance contribute funding to the Nomic Foundation ?
"Readers , please consider this change when you read the comments above this reply ."
Doing so would control veBAL rewards as outlined as a goal of this future proposal .
"MakerDAO gains legitimacy , a diversification of collateral , and a measured , established hand in the real world by participating in HVB assets ."
"As such we should be more aware of what these assets actually are , and what their underlying utility is ."
"Overall the pricing seems fair , but thought as a DAO we were trying to move away from paying contributors in AAVE and instead be more sustainable with stable reserves ."
It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0 percent interest .
"Therefore , a zero coupon bond with a 3 month maturity has a 0.25 duration , a 1 year zero coupon bond has a duration of 1 ."
We would contribute to helping MakerDAO build products that will increase DAI ’ s stablecoin dominance and increase total supply .

I will try to document them as well .
Thanks .
Just some ideas that came around my mind .
"The Lido team has communicated that they fixed all the issues , wrote specific tests , deployed them on a testnet before deploying on mainnet ."
A better way would be to send FRAX protocol all the tokens you would have used in an airdrop .
"It is true that that this doesn ’ t in any way solve the withdrawal issue although it would be unwise to disallow withdrawals as it ’ s not even possible in v2 to granularly prevent this action from happening without freezing everything ( and in general it would set a very bad precedent , users should always be free to withdraw their assets when there is liquidity available ) ."
@ EbenezerGhost sums it up pretty well .
"Yearn is a great project , but the absence of the above mentioned things & now Andre quitted ( even though it ’ s unimportant to the project , it affects the sentiment ) ; we need some solid stuff like status updates & timelines ."
"Voting should start at the start of next week : Compound As we shared earlier , we have done the following : Refunded gas costs to voters on the 2nd proposal ."

I have been waiting for this for a while .
"I lack the critical knowledge to contribute to the solution , as I don ’ t even know how V3 supposedly prevent this ."
"On the other hand , after reading the above paragraphs closely several times , we do believe DST is one of the only ways to deliver it for the below reason : based on the first paragraph , if the SPV is truly separate with the Asset Originator , this reduces risk for Maker but increases risk for Robinland as we lose control over the underlying asset ."
I ’ m not very familiar with Perpetual Protocol and as presented I ’ m not sure this meets the threshold of being something that ’ s obviously good for us from a risk/reward POV .
"Their primary function is to ensure that your code does what you want your code to do and that there are no major flaws , assumptions , or errors in what you wrote as you wrote it ."

Here you can see our founder at the Cosmoverse event .
"As a commitment to the proper decentralization of the protocol , Uniswap Labs had previously provided a royalty free perpetual license for V3 and related trademarks to the Uniswap Grants Program and selected grantees at UGP ’ s discretion ."
"When the AAVE : ETH ( 80/20 ) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave ’ s Safety Module , the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH ( 80/20 ) Balancer V2 pool ."
"DeFi users of the future will expect chain agnostic , multichain user experiences that abstract away the individual blockchains and just give them the best rates and the lowest fees ."
"That said , I am sure we are all watching to see what the new veBAL tokenomics does to the market ."
"Challenges can be summarized as ; An absence of any dedicated roles focused on driving or securing new Job listing or promotion of Keep3r network with protocols An absence of any dedicated effort to attract Keepers to work listed jobs , which in term challenges the legitimacy of claim for the network to be considered truly decentralized Barriers to entry for new participation of Keepers due to initial cost required , i.e ."

Hi @ Boardroom   Great question .
"By approving this proposal , you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos ."
"For every 1 week remaining of a vesting package , the recipient takes a 0.25 percent haircut , and is paid out the remaining in unlocked YFI that they can do whatever they please with ."
"In summary , on the current shape , I can ’ t support the proposal ."
"MKR holders can then use the data to make adjustments to Core Units , such as adjusting budgets , based on which Core Units are delivering the results that MKR holders want ."
I think Maker should first concentrate on accepting Uniswap v3 collateral that is NFT .
E.g .
"We will manage the Maker Twitter account , the agency will help us with the creation and diffusion of announcements/stories we want to launch to a mainstream audience ( clean money , Maker as a DAO , etc ) ."
It would be a disservice to Uniswap for these funds to leak out to other ventures only tangentially related to Uniswap .
"Instead , I think the decoupling of two distinct but related questions ( “ Can the protocol charge fees ” and “ What will the protocol do with the fees that it earns ” ) is where the danger lies ."
"I disagree with your conclusion that the DAO is welsh : receiving a very poor yield relative to the risk it is recommending we undertake What is “ very poor ” and what “ risks ” do you view Maker taking that HVB is not taking… we are pari passu and in effect , piggybacking on HVB ’ s underwriting experience ."
( Side note : it ’ s also a limitation of Governance ) Now on the merit of Chaos   I can not speak to the technical capabilities of the product but it seems to offer the DAO scalability at fewer resources .
We ’ ve tried to be as transparent and open as possible given the circumstances ( full details of which should come later . )
"This violates two core assumption that we used to understand RWA risk , making the authoritarian threat a lot more serious ."
The objective of the COMP rewards program was initially to distribute the token to our users .
I don ’ t want to argue here whether MKR burn works and has a positive effect on the price action .
"Instead , Maker would conduct periodic appraisals of floor price items from each supported NFT series , and then update prices and risk parameters manually through governance ."
"It has to produce Core Units that are independent , with facilitators who have the authority to make their own decisions and are accountable for those decisions ."
How do political systems select good delegates and give them incentives to properly oversee the workforce ?
"What are the option we , the lender , have to withdraw our crypto esp ."
"If total supplies , borrows , and reserves increase due to the change , we would consider impact as a positive outcome validating that users are elastic to reserve factors ."
"DAI is also up to debate if it should be supported as collateral , as bringing stable token as a collateral to v3 is also debatable proposal ."
The Portfolio Purchase Agreement will stipulate mechanisms to ensure that ( i ) the new on boarded assets meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the financing documents and ( ii ) HVBank will act to make sure the Trust ’ s overall portfolio maintains the stipulated risk retention standards .
This seems like an interesting proposition for undercollateralized/uncollateralized RWA lending ( eg .
A market needs to have great enough incentives for depositors to provide enough liquidity to make the cost of borrowing worth it .
With a much larger system surplus we are free to experiment and assist these teams that are dedicated to solving the problem of on chain sophisticated credit .
"Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network , Celer does have a second security model , inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design , that works securely even under this worst case scenario ."
"Considering that Frax does not lack liquidity on mainnet , Olympus wouldn ’ t be taking any risks , Olympus could begin creating a dangerous cycle of hoarding FXS emissions which are used to direct more FXS emissions to themselves , and the OHM/Frax pool has had $ 0 volume the last week , I think this wouldn ’ t be a good use for FXS emissions ."

The gamified nature should also make it relatively simple to track participation and success .
Precisely who is going to have 50 100K or perhaps 250 500K of NFT collateral to borrow given increasing dust limits here and will Maker end up being stuck with vaults of low size not being able to liquidate as dust limits increase ?

This audit started on January 24th and is wrapping up today after 5 weeks of work from 3 auditors .
I got involved in this project as a small MKR holder and I understand exactly where you are coming from .
MakerDAO is already providing capital on Money Markets through D3M ( Direct Deposit DAI Module ) .
The Aave DAO would need to use the BAL holdings for that but its use can be changed if there is other interesting BAL strategies down the line .
How do you preserve the steep cultural understanding of transparency in RWAs ?
"I think our previous inter protocol cooperation with the D3M is a good example of this , more liquidity for Aave , better rates for users more revenue for Maker ."
I can ’ t wait for the future when I will be able to pay in DAI for my groceries and enjoy MKR deflation at the same time .

We already have a massive advantage with DAI being one of the most trusted stablecoins available .
"Suggested increase in RF for ETH and WBTC actually benefits both users and protocol , allows us to capitalise on our market strength ( amazing deal on borrowing eth and btc , for those users who want to bet on that ) and in the long run reserves accumulated from such adjustments are likely way overshoot anything we going collect from stable coin markets in usd value in current market conditions ."

"For the one off opportunities section , it is also necessary to define a scope of what the Maker Brand core unit can do since many of these initiatives depend on having access to the client facing “ product ” and today that product is in the hands of OASIS ( Frontend ) , which is not something that the DAO can control , so we need to find a way to create things that keeps the conversation about Maker going on , for this let ’ s analyze the 4Ps Marketing Mix to find where we can act ."
You can adjust resources by priority .
"Pauljlei : Second , if wstETH is already listed on V3 at that time when BPT for wstETH/wETH is listed , then under high ETH utilization , the high ETH borrow rate can put stress on the existing wstETH/ETH yield farmers on Aave V3 ( at that time ) who are depositing wstETH as collateral and borrowing ETH ."

"I would not extrapolate the TC episode , which is punctual and probably even ( don ’ t kill me ) motivated by good intentions   although with clumsy action , but the relationship between credit or pseudo currency DeFi protocols is not set in stone yet ."
This proposal also provides a significant upside for Aave through the revenue from staking rewards .
The metric to measure success of the experiment is the following : If trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the “ fee switch ” turned on – the experiment is a success .
"Regarding the proposed measures , my opinion : Freeze the stETH market ."

Very detailed proposal .
"While our focus is to use this engagement period on product development for the AAVE community , our hope is to eventually onboard a consortium of community members to create the relevant testing environments and risk evaluations for the Aave protocol on top of the Chaos Labs platform ."
"As each one of these projects has its own complexity and completely different scope , it is simply not realistic to even group them into 1 big proposal targeting Level 2 , as the voters ’ overhead would be so big that it would be difficult to do a clearly rational vote ."

"It is designed this way to benefit our deep margin trading architecture ( not yet released ) , in which any asset can be used as collateral against any other asset ."
Lowering the cognitive costs of voting is also important .
Contributing to these public goods will empower present and future Compound contributors to focus more exclusively on building features and functionality that bring value to the protocol rather than devops configuration and tooling .
We have seen the great work the team has done for Compound and think it should be continued for the following year .

"It is better to be safe to regret , I say this because using 2.0 tools such as excel or some software where the created documents are stored in a centralized for Microsoft or Amazon server is extremely vulnerable to exploits , despite the cost it takes to make the api , it is much better to create it from scratch , the idea is that Maker is entirely made by the community and this is a living example of it"
"The Timelock contains a mix of cTokens and tokens ; the cTokens can be redeemed for their underlying assets Block Speeds Many of the interest rate models were deployed before the Merge , which reduced Ethereum ’ s block speed to 12 seconds ."
Honestly it doesn ’ t really even make sense for us to pair a liquidity pool unless we can use that to farm a pool2 .
I think the work GFX Labs has already done and is planning on doing will well exceed $ 5M in long term value for the protocol .
This is a low risk .

Hey really like this proposal .
I am someone who started not getting paid by Aave directly or indirectly and still find myself doing things outside of the Grants program and Llama to help advance Aave .
Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools .
It ’ s unclear whether the fraud proof network has been audited .
"Outside of the Aave ecosystem , Llama contributes to Balancer , Gitcoin , Nouns , dYdX , Tribe DAO , FWB , and PoolTogether , among others ."

Key BanklessDAO Achievements BANK is one of the most widely held social tokens according to the Forefront market landscape .
"I ’ m receptive to a higher target utilization / kink point up to 80 percent ( vs initially proposed 50 percent ) , as the main risk here is that cETH becomes 100 percent utilized and even 80 90 percent utilization wouldn ’ t bring too high of safety concerns ."
LEXPUNK UPDATE TIME ! !
"In addition to the reserve factor and earning from collateral rewards , BAL and AURA acquisition are taken into account in the SM proposal with Grants + POL in the SM MatthewGraham : The DAO needs to be very careful how the veBAL are used when committing to a long term strategy ."

"Apparently there needs to be a governance bridge in order for these changes to be made Polygon ( as well as Optimism and Arbitrum ) already has a governance bridge It ’ s an area that needs more developer documentation , but it is entirely possible to create a cross chain proposal to do this ."
( Without affecting fee ) We as a DAO must do our best to transition users to V3 .
"Equally , code practices and accessibility are essential for a DAO , we should ensure that future developers can continue the tasks others started , without breaking what ’ s done and keeping the Security and Reliability of the projects : this can be accomplished only through good coding practices and an established quality assurance process within those projects which makes its code more resilience to changes ( ie ."
"In addition , all interfaces would remain completely backward compatible , with only additions for the new v3 features ."
We look forward to see Marc and Aave Chan continue to contribute to AAVE governance .

"As a general principle , empowering specific individuals with a broad mandate is something that should be minimized as much as possible within any DAO , given the risk of scope creep and social capture over time ."
No leap of faith needs to be taken with Llama and the value they can provide for the DAO .
"Context Since 2017 , Maker has been successfully consolidating its leading position in both the lending and decentralized stablecoin markets : In the lending market , Maker enjoys a leading position with 52 percent collateral market share in ETH ( slight increase at 3 percent MoM over last 6 months ) and 48 percent in WBTC ( strong double digit increase at 20 percent MoM over last 6 months ) as of january 2022 ."
"To avoid any further issues , we are no longer using Sablier and will instead continue using the built in streaming function ."
"The crypto landscape has changed significantly over the last few years , and just as Compound needs to adapt to what participants want today , governance also needs to offload what isn ’ t required or safe to support ."
Thats the main reason to stop this gauge .
"The decision to shift incentives from V2 to V3 is mainly strategic , but below , we provide some analysis on the market risk side to aid the community in making a decision : It is good to see that the V2 ETH supply incentives will not be removed in light of the upcoming merge ."
We view this tool as a critical component in determining protocol risk and will be an effective “ white hat ” tool to protect the protocol better .
This is worded in a confusing way .
The current gap refers to what the protocol would need to cover in order to compensate for : Losses arising from adverse events related to existing outstanding debt   i.e .
We would also need to write the code rather than use something already audited .
Curious to hear what community thinks about turning fee switch on Polygon first before Ethereum mainnet .
"With respect to this specific proposal , aspects of it do fall within Llama work scope , as it relates to the funds held by the DAO and how said funds are managed ."
"If we look at USD for example , it is widely held and widely used for global trade ."
The project did obtain legal opinions from several legal advisors .
We can also confirm that borrow caps can be set in the comptroller for cETH and we don ’ t foresee any issues .

"However , the CRV market was not frozen and it seems that the protocol is now at risk of accumulating significant bad debt due to a tactical short position that Avi entered with the intention of precipitating a short squeeze ."
"In summary , I support this proposal and the amounts requested , but probably some changes to the payment schedule sound fair and could benefit the community ."
"We will hire the key team members ( Brand Lead , Comms Lead ) and implement the key internal processes ."
Some of the pieces of the case study that provide a severe lack of confidence in the statistical significance of the results include but are not limited to : The authors depeg stETH to a large deviation and measure whether liquidations occur as a metric of protocol health .
"While limiting the number of things that are voted on may seem like it reduces how “ democratic ” a system is , it can actually increase it if it empowers voters by giving them a clearer and simpler set of decisions to make ."
"Users may also eventually want to long or short FXS / FRAX , and having deep pools is immensely beneficial to that as well ."

"At this point , we simply ask for FRAX users to come try us out ."
Also stable collateral does not produce income whatsoever for Maker .
"When we approached the Frax Team about unlocking , we expressed our desire to move our pre Convex vault TVL ( ~436K LP tokens ) to the new Convex vault ."

"As quote is 1 1 on the testnet , the minimum amount of LPs would be 3 ."
fig : I would like to point out 94.4 percent is a massive amount of the treasury to place in other smart contracts and incur counter party risk .
It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi .

I think if it can be 3 month renewal it would make ppl more comfortable for the initial period and then we could look at a longer grant at renewal .
The initial implementation also uses simple stress tests which quantify if there is less than a 1 percent chance of Frax able to fully meet its liability over a 1 and 3 month time horizons assuming no changes in liability or collateral ratio ( which are big assumptions ) but can be refined by incorporating a scenario analysis framework in the future .

"Based on my years in investment banking for financial institutions , I like the debt idea because : Debt is obviously cheaper and less dilutive than equity/ token financing Debt in fixed rates is something that the DeFi ( institutional ) market is truly interested in and peer to peer or peer to protocol money markets haven ’ t yet been able to meet   due to their competitive disadvantage vs a protocol that is sovereign with its own stable Debt can be tweaked up / down based on needs and market   to do this with token/ equity is much more difficult Having said that , probably the sweet spot is a combination of various financing sources , also considering the amounts we are talking about ."
Empower the teams to assess how much capacity goes into “ keeping the lights on ” which barely gets challenged vs. Capacity for incremental revenue projects .

"The regulators of the US , EU and the UK convene to consider aggressive measures to contain the crypto world integration with traditional finance ."
I ’ d like to add two suggestions : Each Core Unit should have to continually justify its existence by tying its cost to the explicit benefit it will ultimately generate or the costs it will ultimately save ( as any business unit in a traditional company would need to do on a periodic basis ) .
As FRAX looks to diversify their collateral base the community has been forward looking in using RWAs to do so .

RWAs do not come built with these levers .
"Hiring trusted talent faster , without intermediaries In this scenario , the hiring parties within the DAO or a portfolio of its projects are able to fill vacancies faster through setting up their talent branch and/or setting up job specific bounties for talent to get recommended to ."
This LP is then bonded as kLP which generates newly minted KP3R tokens over time which the protocol Job owner can use to pay keepers .
See the below for a summary of the eligibility criteria .

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?
Actual or potential friction between owners or potential successors .
In a normal situation minting MKR simply dilutes the rights to profit among more holders .
It is the risk of capital losses using stressed scenarios ( hence falling into the unexpected loss realms as no loss for crypto loans is expected in normal circumstances ) .
rune : Focus Objectives can quickly change as market conditions or other external factors forces them to change .
This in turn increases the odds that MakerDAO will get paid back .

"Protocols could , in theory , use collateralized , fixed rate borrowing on protocols like Aave or Yield Protocol to get fixed rates , but this has certain drawbacks : If not actively managed , a DAO can be liquidated in a sudden fashion Limited ability to set various terms in advantageous ways ( tenor , discount , etc ) Critically , the need to overcollateralize in highly liquid assets ensures that the DAOs that need this option the most , even when they have strong balance sheets , are unlikely to use this option ."

It is clear that targeting the supply and demand programatically of these lending based protocols is not practical   as the relative low liquidity of these underlying protocols makes it extremely difficult if not near impossible to reduce the investment programatically   as automated withdrawals of supply from these credit driven protocols   without manual intervention and monitoring   have a medium to high probability of creating a credit crunch which could significantly impact collateral value .

"This happens via two parallel channels : Real world rails themselves migrate natively on chain Asset constructs familiar to traditional finance ( equities , bonds , derivatives ) are issued by entities that live natively on chain As of now , the perceived difference between how MakerDAO categorizes RWAs and D3Ms lies in how risk is classified and thus which core units have the burden of assessment ."

"Have a think about this game mechanics : The “ credit game ” , Maker generally is to play in RWA , is a case of infinitely repeating games between lender and borrower ( first credit facility replaced by second ad infinitum ) with increasing payouts ( increasing size of credit facility ) , with informational asymmetry during a specific game ( borrower knows more than lender ) , but with credible sanctions for non cooperation on the side of the lender at the end of each game ( no further credit lines and broken market reputation ) ."

"Lending is the use case IMO that can truly proliferate stable coins , I am advocating for real world lending in this proposal , as there is a gigantic diverse base of collateral to tap into , but this can also include lending to digital asset firms and hopefully even other protocols one day !"
How much more veBAL does the DAO need to acquire in order to create sufficient APR on deposits to entice deposits relative to alternatives which offer there native token as a complimentary incentive ?

Why can ’ t we make this permissionless ?
"Additionally , their initial work on Flexible Voting would enable governance tokens locked in other protocols ( for example , cUNI ) to be leveraged for cross protocol governance voting ."
"Additionally , the above spend is computed assuming a constant reward APY across different Reward Multipliers and their shares of profitable supply , not allocating an arbitrary amount of COMP tokens directed at yield farming which would incidentally change the reward APY for each Reward Multiplier ( while the total amount distributed would be constant ) ."
"Thus , we want to engage the said community in each proposal , from simulation creation to testing review to proposed change enforcement ."

"Can you please provide comparisons to Q1 2020 , Q1 2019 , and Q1 2018 when rates started to rise ."
We ’ ll begin by elaborating on these areas .
"Rather than delisting these assets entirely , it may cause less user friction by turning off the assets as collateral instead ( e.g. , changing LTV to 0 percent and gradually reducing LT ) ."

"In the same proposal by @ TylerEther , it was suggested to end all COMP rewards programs and only use them to kickstart new markets moving forward ."
"The following point also made sense : MIP40c3 SP61 : Modify Core Unit Budget   Real World Finance ( RWF 001 ) Given the scale of the proposed budget increase ( 7x Q4 RWF cash burn ) , eight figures annually including the 3 month upfront contingency payment , we believe the DAO should receive more detail and substantiation ."
"2 ) Host a IRIS/1UNI farm on Harmony in perpetuity , directly rewarding Uniswap investors that stake at Hermes ."

"In optimistic systems , liveness of the fraud proof detection agents is another consideration ; we discuss this more later ."
"i would like to correct myself … FXS has a hard cap of 100m circ supply , so the minting would stop if FXS total supply hits 100m and could only restart minting once the supply has dropped below the circ 100m hard cap ."
Hence the need for a much lower reward decay rate .

In short : RWA counterparty self interest does not equate to best terms for themselves and worst terms for MakerDAO .
I see creating the website as a means to unification .
We are willing to accept and work with the fact that probably this next 12 months several changes and adjustments will be necessary to get all dimensions of RWA deployment working smoothly : from legal structure over reporting and collateralization calculations to IT components interfacing with Maker .
Trust that MakerDAO token holders will continue to exercise excellent judgment .
I went to the AAVE discord to get an update on StMATIC but they said to give this thread a bump to see the status/progress .
"Some believe it should be put off until Uniswap gains greater market share , while others believe that monetizing the protocol today could rekindle interest in the protocol , governance , and UNI ."
And big misalignment with the metaDAOs .
An immediate return on token will surpass the LP income at least a medium long period of time .
"Importantly , we ’ ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on chain activity ."
It ’ s time to look beyond the end of our noses and start positioning for the next source of demand for on chain credit .
192 mentions in China Some well known outlets prove to be true Maker fans as they mention us extremely often Examples : The Defiant = 14 mentions ; BeInCrypto = 14 mentions ; Bitcoin Ethereum News = 13 mentions ; Blockworks = 10 mentions ; etc .
Glad to see this proposal .

"Proposal : In this proposal , Hermes DeFi is seeking an Additional Use Grant for the Uniswap V3 core contracts on which to build an AMM/DEX platform on the Harmony blockchain ."
"Once deployed , Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem ."
"I think there should be a definite stopping time , so we can adequately address all of these concerns ."
Why has the RWF recommended that the DAO accept this proposal which does not protect the DAO from receiving a very poor yield relative to the risk it is recommending we undertake .
"Sometimes , one or two steps better than leaping too far… All the best ,"
This will create a leverage trading market on any Fraxswap pair that has sufficient liquidity deposited on Futureswap .
"Additionally , SES has argued in the past for a consensus mechanism to determine a DAO wide budget cap ."
The legacy financial system is dependent on private organizations and third party services which makes it challenging for individuals to connect to the open internet and transact with one another .
"Kris gave the example of Amazon ; I ’ ll give a different example , Google ."
It is amazing to work with this project .
This is one of the only clear attack surfaces native to Uniswap ’ s current governance parameters .
Overall very supportive of this initiative .
"I suggest that to the extent we feel stuck , new terms are exactly what we need to better comprehend where we ’ ve been , where we are , and where we need to go ."
"The Nomic foundation has requested funding at a specific amount ; as strongly as we may share the ideal of supporting public goods with a ‘ yes ’ to requests from top quality tooling contributors like Nomic , there is no getting around the fact that the specific amount requested , together with the existence of the protocol ’ s other priorities ( including internal funding for the protocol ’ s development needs and other public goods funding ) unavoidably makes this is a budgeting exercise ."
Does that make sense ?
"Benefits : Potentially lower risk to MakerDAO ( Maker may have seniority of repayment or additional capital buffer versus the issuing platform ) Less in house expertise or review needed Can potentially serve both floor , fractionalized , and non floor assets Drawbacks : Greater governance risk   Maker relies on underlying platform to maintain appropriate risk management Competitors : Stablecoin protocols such as Fei , Frax , and Abracadabra Several projects are working on NFT pricing algos to move away from floor pricing , these orgs could be competitors or participants in Maker lending mechanism Business Strategy : Serving Large Volume Users With access to the lowest possible cost of capital through the DAI holder base , Maker has a unique opportunity to form the foundation of the NFT lending market , similar to our role within crypto lending markets ."
"These decisions get passed into the Wormhole endpoint on Ethereum , where they get attested by the Wormhole guardian network ."
"The Uniswap Foundation , which has since absorbed UGP , is now excited to launch the liquidity mining program to support the Uniswap Optimism ecosystem ."
"I think it makese sense to charge more fees for strategies with an inherant edge : i expect to be charged less if its jsut farming and dumping a convex/curve pool because I can do it myself as a pleb , however , something more esoteric requiring smart yield routing to different protocol am happy to pay more fees ."
As an example : Senior tranche 1 Senior tranche 2 Mezzanine tranche 1 Mezzanine trance 2 Junior tranche ( first loss ) Eumenes : This is easier for single asset pool transactions from one asset class originator and more difficult for transactions with multiple asset pools Right .
"Expanding it to other chains is a no brainer & on an L2 , the impact will be even more positive in terms of price slippage to traders ."
just letting you know
That being the case it seems that you would likely make better use of capital by paying some 3rd party to insure the protocol solvency in the event of some Black Swan Event .
Let me work on this offline and come back on a proposed way forward .
As an update to my previous post : On polygon : CRV has now reached 100 percent supply and 100 percent borrow cap MAI also has 100 percent borrow cap Also it ’ s a bit weird imo that CRV on polygon has a so high tvl compared to mainnet .
"By deprecating this pair and moving FRAX FXS LPs to Fraxswap under the gauge system , FXS immediately becomes 40 percent more scarce as the amount emitted per day drops from 12,500+8400=20,900 to just 12,500 across the entire protocol ."

"In fact   the SAME “ liquidity amounts ” , at different price points , do equal different numbers of tokens and also different dollar values ."
Meaningful market share in industry .
"At the moment , the Aave treasury holds the following distribution of funds , both in general across the different networks , and specifically for stablecoins ."
"We find many similarities between the D3M protocol to protocol approach , and @ Rune ’ s MetaDAO vision – the D3M is an organic version of the DAO to DAO construct championed by our founder ."
"Demonstration with Example Values MKR market cap = $ 2 billion Maker annual profit = $ 100 million Annual MKR buyback = $ 50 million ( remaining $ 50 million added to surplus buffer ) Currently all MKR buybacks are burned , yielding a buyback yield of 2.5 percent in this example ."
"For those who might not fully understand , reserves actually work like a sort of a tax protocol puts on a revenue , it collects from Borrowers ."
Definitely in support of actually using the Twitter account with a significant following .

"The WOO token is highly liquid as it is listed on many of the top and largest exchanges , with hedging available through perpetual swaps on several leading exchanges , including WOO X and Binance ."
RWF should be no different—the community either trusts us to apply our skill and do our jobs or it doesn ’ t .
In banking ( under basel III ) and insurance ( under solvency II ) there is a Tier 2 capital category ( different though for banking and insurance ) .
"The distribution seems reasonably well spread to me , with just a small uptick for the four longest serving contributors ( towards the right of the plot ) ."
I want to be clear here since we seem to be completely in a no mans land on what a MIP6 application means to governance nor what the real process is for an Asset Originator to navigate Maker proper .
TL ; DR   Uniswap Foundation is an entity that can represent the interests of the protocol and its various stakeholders .
"This might not solve the high gas fee issue on mainnet , but with plans for Compound III to launch on other EVMs , a rebate mechanism that included the L2 migration ( perhaps even in one click fashion ? )"
"Upon HVBank presenting a participation opportunity , the MBPTrust will receive access to a secured online data room folder which will contain a copy of HVBank ’ s underwriting memo and associated loan documents ."
"For example , you are farming arBNB arCAKE and the rewards are in arCAKE , you are not able to withdraw that arCAKE into CAKE but what you can do is sell your arCAKE for arUSD to realize your profits why cant you just sell it for FRAX and use FRAX to realize your profits ?"
I truly appreciate it and this makes discussion more healthy and transparent .
We want to change that .
"To summarize some of AGD ’ s tangible impact since inception : Received 1336 applications and approved 187 different grants Awarded $ 124,000 across 39 different prizes at ten hackathons Pushed forward initiatives outside of grants funding including setting up the Aave Guardians , facilitating bug bounty payments and advocating to receive OP rewards See below for where we can improve on tracking the impact from grantees ."
There ’ s a small but very important caveat that I ’ d like to help with .
I think there is a better solution for price feeds served by a series of mandated entities .
"That being said I ’ m in favor of the more conservative risk parameters suggested , as such , and to reflect recommendations , I switched my vote in the current Snapshot from “ YAE ” to “ ABSTAIN ” and will support a new snapshot requesting the newly suggested risk parameters ."

What if instead Frax provides them with the liquidity and then they can use Olympus Pro or the TWAMM to pay it back over 90 days selling FST for FRAX into the market   liquidity as a service as it were The swap should also be at a discount given the imbalance in utility of their token and maturity of the protocol   for example see the Fiat DAO swap Olympus did at 50 percent discount OIP 72 : FIAT DAO x Olympus Partnership   OlympusDAOForum

"Upgradability with little restriction carries additional risk , like we have seen so far with Compound v2 ."
"I Approve of this proposal as an original OG ( presale+early locker ) at the protocol level , it indeed doesn ’ t make much sense that this pool takes up most of the rewards while most of the trading happens at other pairs ( fxs/weth ) and on cex ( binance/ftx ) I also see zero possibility for any kind of death spiral or malfunctions I don ’ t know why anyone would be scared of that it ’ s not like all the market LIQ is in this pool , there ’ s like 20m across other pools and then there ’ s the cex ’ s markets also fxs crashing doesnt impact the stability of frax it makes it that if someone were to redeem frax at that exact time , they get more fxs but as the Oracle would not update this in this real time speed it would be hard to do that plus of course we would have people defending the price ( even the protocol itself with the buyback funds ) in any case frax should unlock this pool enable the fraxswap pool right away put it on gauge right away and put out a bribe right away for first 2 weeks to get some apy going"

Frankly speaking i am not convinced we have a problem here .
Implementing a single ABI with standardized call data for creating proposals on multiple chains is as straightforward as implementing a single function type from the enacting contract on source chain ; the developer simply writes a send ( ) and receive ( ) function with the passage of a generic bytes array .

"For future pools with FRAX , we are building pool by pool tranching so that ( if desired ) FRAX will only be lending to the senior tranche ( taking a lower rate and also taking on less default risk ) ."
Then should we change its interest model again depending on merge schedule ?
We will pose those questions to the community shortly to kickstart the conversation .
"In this manner , we will integrate directly with the Aave protocol and provide transparent simulation insights ."
It is not a barrier but rather a consideration much like similar Reserves on various Aave deployments .
"Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH , the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch , with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~ $ 4K ."

"Our rationale : ETH USDT makes up the largest ETH Stable spot trading market in the world today ( ~3x the volume of ETH USDC across both DEX/CEX competitors ) , of all ETH pairs Uniswap should be targeting this volume rather than disincentivizing its most efficient liquidity Relatedly , Uniswap decentralized market share in ETH USDT is much lower than that of the other two ETH Stable pairs being considered ( ~50 percent against , versus > 90 percent in both ETH USDC and ETH DAI ) While the ETH DAI pools do indeed have smaller TVL than ETH USDT , they are similar when normalized against volume serviced Ultimately , we believe that it would behoove the community to utilize ETH USDT as the primary test case to see if market share can truly be improved by utilizing the fee switch as an LP incentivization tool given the market share runway that currently exists ."

It doesn ’ t provide revenues .
"However , over the history of Ethereum ( ~9 years ) , none of the platform accrued compoundable value to ETH token holders ."
Implementation of a Supply Cap would enable the Aave community to mitigate this risk by restricting the quantity of 1INCH in the lending pool which can be maintained via the governance process based upon secondary market liquidity conditions .
Don ’ t see how this is in anyway a threat to depeg .
"I also think it ’ s likely that the whole concept of focus objectives will be less important over time , and eventually will disappear entirely as the DAO becomes decentralized and autonomous enough ."

Wondering if anyone can explain to me the discrepancy I am noting : The current proposal says that the original proposal ( Dec 21 ) indicated : “ …at the start of every quarter OpenZeppelin will create a proposal to update the service fee payment in accordance with the formula outlined in the proposal. ” I am noting a discrepancy with what was originally proposed and approved in the initial proposal back on 22 Dec 2021  which actually says : “ At the start of every 6 month period for one year OpenZeppelin will create a formal Compound Governance Proposal to update the service fee payment in accordance with the simple formula below : ” ( see page 5 of the proposal from link in the original proposal : Compound DAO Continuous Audit Proposal   Final   Google Docs ) Just wondering why we are not following the 6 month period as approved in the Dec 21 proposal which had significant back/forth as well as significant discussion surrounding the payment and method .

"Usually , what I do understand are issues about governance and surplus buffer/burning ."
Data and simulations referenced in this proposal are listed in this sheet .
The deAaveAdapter smart contract validates message sender address and chainId deAaveAdapter mints the requested amount of aTokens by calling mintUnbacked function of Portals deAaveAdapter redeems received aTokens and transfers the resulting tokens to the receiver by calling withdraw method of AAVE protocol This design guarantees that any amount outstanding to Portals on Chain 2 is backed by the same amount of collateral locked in the deAaveAdapter smart contract on Chain 1 .
"We don ’ t see any major insolvency risk ( at current parameters potentially ~ $ 2M with a > 20 percent depeg ) , though do note that this is with current liquidity conditions and could be higher if a more severe depeg occurs ."

"Based on the token distribution , the 1INCH token holders are more centralized than UNI token holders , as UNI has more active addresses but fewer whales ."
Suggesting that any service provider approaching the DAO should only do so after incurring an incredibly high expense is to introduce a form of bureaucratic capture and incumbency bias not dissimilar from what we see when big banks or big tech companies lobby congress to regulate their industry .
"If Compound had been more open with its roadmap and process , the Community would have been able to give comments and share ideas , rather than seeing it spending time immersed in CompoundGateWay and then switched to the multi chain strategy at a very belated stage ."
"Also lets accelerate these key elements of the bigger Organic DAI Growth strategy teej : The D3M and RWAs will merge into a single deployment mechanism to infuse DAI into the ground floor of a new , parallel , and uncorrelated economic engine ."
"So the metadaos will have to figure out the challenge of bootstrapping decentralized reputation , as well as develop extremely strong frameworks that means someone sybil attacking would literally have to do the work of 2 people , which then isn ’ t really a problem ."

COMP The COMP token and its holders represent the governance of the Compound market .
"Assuming a utilization rate of 39 percent under the old rate model ( 2.5 percent borrow rate and 0.9 percent supply rate ) , both borrowers and suppliers would have higher welfare between 44 percent utilization ( where supply rate rises above 0.9 percent under the new rate model ) and 50 percent utilization ( where borrow rate rises above 2.5 percent under the new rate model ) ."
"Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars , Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster , cheaper , and better ."
"Similar to the positive AMPL rebase , if ETHW retains non negligible value , raising the interest rate can not completely eliminate 100 percent pool utilization since the borrow duration can be short ( within minutes ) ."
The key lever was the ability to adjust the money ( DAI ) supply via interest rates .
Im not sure if there are any other plans than that currently .
"We built the first money markets aggregator on Ethereum in a hackathon last year , and would be interested to see how we might be able to get involved with building an Extension as a part of what we are building with our v2 ."

"RWAs would go on to 15 months later to pass the 35M threshold , drive uncorrelated revenues , and bolster the peg ."
My main warning is that we NEED to be wary of losing market share to other AMMs on Dex aggregators .
"Before we try that out , we ’ ll need to find a real account to impersonate in the test ."
"It is too easy to say “ being a big protocol , you need as many risk vendors as possible ” , but 1 ) not true , what Aave needs is a good vendor , compromised , showing continuous results ( and additional independent contributors , via grants for example ) 2 ) the Aave DAO is the main “ victim ” of these “ we are all friends , anyway the Aave DAO pays ” ."
How does Backed Assets monetize this issuance ?

"Traster_Tray : All these changes may be understandable changes but there were plenty of controversies and for those who may not have been onboard as they were approved , there is a feeling of promises broken and frustration ."
These rewards are proportionally distributed to all the BPT suppliers inside the Aave Protocol .
"There are a few options open to the protocol that it hasn ’ t taken yet + the change to ve ( 3,3 ) , that is still on the changelog , would greatly help incentivize vesting vs ( just ) holding ."
Actual pay of strategists or any contributor is explicitly out of scope from the proposal : 0xJiji : Contributor compensation specifics .
"In order to build off this momentum and seize market share , we believe Maker should execute on three key areas it has already laid the infrastructure for ."

"I fully agree that TVL , market share , and trading volume growth should be the Uniswap Protocol ’ s top priorities in this phase of its lifetime ."
"My initial thoughts are to keep the BAL sizing and to do the tokenswap first , then bonding curve later ."
"Second , the proposal is remarkable from the perspective of decentralization , reinforcing the idea that Aave DAO utilizes services from various contributors and service providers to ensure protocol sustainability and the ops ."
We invite you all to explore the Dashboard and look forward to hearing your feedback .
We are waiting on a more substantial response by the team on how they intend to address the loss .
"Abstract Perform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging 14,666.67 AAVE from the Economic Reserve for 200,000 BAL token ."

"Considering total volume ( instead of Messari real volume ) , CRV ADV ( 150MM USD ) is still almost 700 percent larger than CVX ADV ( 21MM USD ) ."
"In the spirit of this proposal trying to have a lower signal to noise ratio , it feels like prioritization process is the most noisy area ."
The advantages are : High efficiency ( cost and time efficient ) High flexibility to focus on priority topics Highly skilled resources Focus on our 5 missions : 1 ) Define brand strategy and implementation plan for new strategic partnerships .
"The distribution of v1INCH is fairly concentrated , with the 1inch Foundation holding 23.64 percent and the next 9 top holders holding around 37.5 percent of the v1INCH supply ."
"The current tokenomics of Hermes DeFi revolve around two tokens , $ IRIS and $ PLTS ."
ChrisBlec : Can you please provide a little more context on what exactly happened here ?
I ’ ll give my take as well .
Spreading out our votes in exchange for bribes will likely lead to us getting $ 100 200k while we miss out on the chance to increase the value of our assets ( we hold about $ 1m in TEMPLE ) and increase the liquidity of our partner thats holding a big chunk of the total FRAX supply on its books ( about 15 percent of the FRAX thats in not in AMO ’ s )
The only possible prioritization mechanism would rely on purely voter preferences and informal debate/conversation .
It is common for companies to provide cost and schedule guidance for material projects under development .
We ’ ll work on the improvements/issues that we believe are most important to the protocol .
"The reason to sell crv because it is useless for Frax , not because needs cash"
"Senate   $ 3,000   a one stop solution for delegates to stay aware of all active proposals ( on chian + off chain ) across DAOs , receive reminders for unvoted proposals , and showcase their governance activity ."
"Additionally , discussions about this work revolve deeply around the teams doing the work and the potential basis ( existent or perceived ) ."
"However , there are a few points that I made above that seem to be elided in your reply : Software that is used to make statistical predictions ( especially for risk parameters ) has a ‘ garbage in , garbage out ’ problem — if I could verify that the inputs and the models were trained correctly and with some notion of statistical accuracy , then I could have confidence ."
This has made it impossible to scope out and provide larger and longer term grants due to UNI price risk .
I don ’ t believe this fits into any overarching plan .

"Metis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain , often executing faster than your web browser can process them , and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them ."
We were born out of EthGlobal last year .
You haven ’ t made a case for why further liquidity is required for FRAX   for example a good reason for additional FRAX would be if there isn ’ t enough liquidity to make it worth a arbitrager ’ s resources to keep the peg at $ 1 .
"BiLira aims to bridge the gap between web 2.0 ( monetized by fiat ) and web 3.0 ( fueled by crypto assets ) , to offer a convenient on ramp and off ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance ."
Aztec will also expand the scope of the grants program to encourage development of alternative interfaces with the Aztec SDK .
Ask me a question ?
"General Discussion i really think this is something we should put some time in to , im all for RWA lending but am also aware of its risks ."
"Liquidity depth for stablecoins are as equally important as having as many trading pairs   and I think this change will help increase FRAX liquidity further the FRAX protocol uses protocol funds to fund a mega deep pool , so it has no need to pay others to do so ."
"While I understand the need to take serious action , I am also worried the community might be overreacting ."
Just to have a better understanding .
"Currently , voting on the Aave Governance on Ethereum is what can be considered as pretty expensive , in a range of $ 20  $ 200 depending on the network ’ s congestion ."
"From my point of view , keeping the protocol solvent and protecting liquidity providers should be top priority ."
ERC 20 transfers do not require addresses to be KYCed .
"Our secure bridges offer cross chain transfers with Ethereum , Binance and 3 other chains ."
This is probably just the first example of more radical innovation that can occur at the edges of the Maker Ecosystem through the power of permissionless innovation that MetaDAOs unleash .
Freezing an asset ( disable supply and borrowing ) .
"if restored , what new rate of weekly allocation to vKP3R will be maintained given the planned allocations to new curve gauges for ibAsset + USDC pairs ?"
You bring up excellent points and did a great job of fleshing out the pros and cons of different implementations .

"Given our experience in the past , BGD will act as a point of contact for security disclosures concerning the Aave ecosystem and will take action on them ."
"Again , should the community look to pursue this application further , the RWF team will embark on comprehensive risk assessment ."
"Following the Consensus Check phase , we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on chain vote ."
Its aim is to estimate the impact on supply profitability across different relative amounts of rewards given to the protocol users .
How can we empower teams to show that they ’ re achieving their mandate ?
"Thus , I ’ d rather see Uniswap bring in this income via liquidity providing in their own pools versus taking fees away from the LPs ."
This puts a guaranteed hard upward cap on the Dai price by directly incentivizing vault usage .
and 2000 FXS ?
( Note the recent clarifying post from @ devinwalsh . )
"It ’ s entirely possible that if Maker starts paying those , it ’ s going to be game over from a regulatory standpoint in fairly short order ."
I co founded Bidali   a reg compliant multi chain crypto payments solution working on enabling cryptocurrency for more p2p real world commerce .
This will almost definitely result in overall Frax liquidity decreasing .
"In the next section we describe Uniswap specific security considerations , then provide a security overview of the bridges ."
"A growth in user comfort and understanding , for me , would be the ultimate goal and I think that likely this could be achieved via this proposal with comparatively little cost overhead With regards to coordinate , those are some interesting points and it ’ s good to start a discussion on these ."
Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL : ETH pool .
"@ bgdlabs we will work alongside you to make this process easier , including today ’ s proposal ."
"Any fees , costs and expenses for RWA Foundation will be paid from the cash waterfall ."
Happy to dig in to your questions more at a later date ( but currently on a doom cycle of calls )
"First , the RWF CU does not set anything ."
"Additionally , would be interesting if Gauntlet could analyse the Curve liquidity on stETH and the sizes of those positions , given that any bigger position exit from stETH could actually further decrease the liquidity ( increase the de peg ) and affect the ability to liquidate for these positions that are closest to potential liquidations ."

"Set up weekly Steering Committee calls to share progress , make decisions and mitigate risks , as well as community update processes ."
"So we could incentivize a group of pools for WETH USDC with different managers and , over time , LPs would likely gravitate towards more effective managers ."
I think you are making a crucial point on over/ under collateralisation .

I acknowledge the DAO is going to navigate through some short term budgetary constraints during this time and Core Units have a role to play to mitigate its effects .
"Alternatively , HVB may also opportunistically liquidate performing portfolio loans ."
